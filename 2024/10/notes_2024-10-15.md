- To Dennis: can RCh provide assistance with obtaining the Oracle ASFU license for me? Show how painful it is to use execute SQL in DM. Can RCH provide partial ownership to the ASFU license? provide financial assistance.
- Can RCH change the paymeny cycle? NET 10/15? 2 months is too long

# Draft for 143 Add calculated KI to JAK Summary page
Scientists requested to add a calculated Ki value to the summary tab of JAK2-Degrader, where dotmatics can do the conversion of IC50 to Ki based on the assay conditions by using the following equation:

`Ki=IC50/(1+[Tracer]/Kd)`

- Min had already derived estimates for the (1+[Tracer]/Kd) value and provided the following:

```
TYK2 IC50 / 32.5 
JAK1 IC50 / 11.5 
JAK2 V617F IC50 / 10.16
```

Spencer Trinh (RCH Solutions) wrote the proper SQL statement to add the value and updated the Datasource within DM DEV.

The data will be presented on the JAK2-Degrader Page. Other cell lines will be added down the road in a similar fashion, such as JH2 WT.

### Impact Analysis
Spencer and Genaro reviewed the underlying Datasource (SUMM_JAK2), and the code logic only adds 3 new lines of SQL code that will calculate these Ki values.

### Implementation Plan
Spencer Trinh will write the SQL code to add to the existing SUMM_JAK2 datasource.

### Roll Out Plan
Once the SQL code is tested and completed on DEV, it will be copied and pasted into PROD.

### Back Out Plan
If changes need to be rolled back we will remove the 3 lines of SQL code to set it back to its original state. There are back-up copies of the original SQL code.

### Implementation Date/Time Information
As soon as approval is received.

## INVESTIGATE CRO ELN are not resolving the reagent masks for internal chemists BUG 128

```sql

select * from ds3_userdata.tm_text_masks where mask_id = 9
```

## placeholder masks for reactants and solvents

#### experiment ids to test:
- bc row_num is null in ds3_userdata.eln_reagents it doesn't show up; need to use uid and newest mask_id
- ** - means also has issue with placeholder, hypothesis is when using mask_id = 9, need to reference newer mask_id 1082/1066 and use uid not row 
- ++ - uses the old way of placeholders: {{solvent volume:row 1}} & {{reactant volume or quant:row 2}} & {{product quantity:row 1}} this works
