Emailed Emilee from DM in response to her stating accessing the Notebook from Studies seems to be working on her end, but not on PreludeTx or my end:

## SQL Queries testing for Chun's request

- this shows:

```

- this results in:

- when joining on each of these subqueries, it will match on the `ID = 2`, `CHILD_ID=3`, `BIOREG_ID=AB000002`, 

- the explicit joins are: `c ON a.id = c.owner_id` & `b ON b.child_id = a.child_id`

- this is what is need for `string_value` table:
```sql
select * from c2c.string_value
where owner_id = 2
and type_id = 6

-- insert 
INSERT INTO C2C.STRING_VALUE (
    ID, VERSION, TYPE_ID, VALUE, VALUE_OPTION_ID, OWNINGCLASS, OWNER_ID, VALUE_ID
)
VALUES (
    seq_string_value.NEXTVAL,
    1,                        
    6,
