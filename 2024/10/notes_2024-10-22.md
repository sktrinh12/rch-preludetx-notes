Chun Chen requested an update to the data in ADC_REG_INFO. This involves updating specific data values and adding a new record in the base tables.

Spencer Trinh (RCH Solutions) investigated where the base tables were and wrote the proper SQL to update them in order for ADC_REG_INFO to display PRT5000315 properly.

The data will be presented on the Browser module within the Bioregister module under the ADC Info subsection.

### Impact Analysis
These changes were reviewed and will not impact other tables or data views. Only base tables will be affected; one new row and one change for C2C.STRING_VALUE base table. The value for Antibody Target will be added and the Payload will be changed from PRT1010344 to PRT1011307. 

### Implementation Plan
Spencer Trinh will write the SQL code to be executed by Dotmatics.

### Roll Out Plan
Ask Dotmatics to execute the SQL in PROD. They will verify the results and create a back-up like previously.

### Back Out Plan
In case of issues, run SQL code to revert the Payload to its original, PRT1010344 and delete the row that was added for Antibody Target. Dotmatics can execute this.

### Implementation Date/Time Information
Execute the changes as soon as approval is received.
