## 📝 Day 13, Wednesday - `notes_2024-10-23.md`

- Added Gautam to restricted chemist group, but then Raul told me to remove and add to Biologist group instead; based on email title: `Minor Change / Support Request`
- Meeting with Jeff and Min about User Story 143. New constants to use in Ki calculation for JAK2-degrader: 

```
JH2 WT: Ki=IC50/7.875
JH2 V617F: Ki=IC50/10.16
JH2 TYK2: Ki=IC50/32.5
JH2 JAK1: Ki=IC50/11.49
```

- added new Ki values for JH2 JAK1 with HY-102500 as a test for the calculation:

```sql
ROUND(TO_NUMBER(REGEXP_REPLACE(MIN(ic50_nm_jh2_jak1), '[^0-9.]', '')) /11.49, 4)   AS ki_jh2_jak1,

-- with less than/greater sign logic:

CASE
    WHEN REGEXP_LIKE(MIN(ic50_nm_jh2_tyk2), '[^0-9.]') THEN
        REGEXP_SUBSTR(MIN(ic50_nm_jh2_tyk2), '[^0-9.]') ||
        TO_CHAR(
            ROUND(TO_NUMBER(REGEXP_REPLACE(MIN(ic50_nm_jh2_tyk2), '[^0-9.]', '', 'g')) / 32.5, 4)
        )
    ELSE
            TO_CHAR(ROUND(MIN(ic50_nm_jh2_tyk2) / 32.5, 4))
END AS ki_jh2_tyk2,
```


```sql
-- check if it shows in TABLE 
select 
    ki_jh2_jak1 
from summ_jak2 
where ki_jh2_jak1 is not null

-- just to check this datapoint exists

- Confirm changes to `c2c.string_value` base table won't affect other things: 
- The view, `C2C.DICTIONARIES` pulls from multiple base tables: 
    * `resource__U`: Main source of data.
    * `string_value`: Used for RESTRICT_TO (with TYPE_ID = 4) and DICTIONARY_TYPE (with TYPE_ID = 3).
    * `people`: For CREATOR_NAME and LAST_UPDATER information. 
- CD123 is not stored directly in the string_value table, but rather in `resource__U` table
- The `STRING_VALUE` table is used in two parts:
    1. In a subquery for the RESTRICT_TO column, aggregating values where TYPE_ID = 4.
    2. In the pivot for the DICTIONARY_TYPE column, where TYPE_ID = 3 is transformed into the s_3 column.
- because `STRING_VALUE` table doesn't contain `CD123` nor does this view select the right `TYPE_ID` it shouldn't affect this view if a new row is added to `STRING_VALUE`. In this view the TYPE_ID = 3 or 4 whereas the TYPE_ID = 6 for `ADC_REG_INFO` view. 

```sql
SELECT ID, KEY, CUSTOM_KEY, TYPE_ID 
FROM resource__U 
WHERE 
KEY = 'CD123' OR 
CUSTOM_KEY = 'CD123'

-- what is shown in the bioregister ADC List -> Add new ADC, Target drop-down menu
select * 
from c2c.dictionaries 
where dictionary_type = 'Target'

-- the drop down list for AB Target for Antibody (can edit if already exists)
select *
from c2c.dictionaries 
where dictionary_type = 'AB Target'
order by Key 
--bioreg_id = 'Dict000037'

-- after editing the ADC in bioregister to be CD123 this appears:
select * 
from string_value
where value = 'CD123'
```
