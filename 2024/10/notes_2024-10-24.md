## üìù Day 14, Thursday - `notes_2024-10-24.md`

- confirmation from Melvin on execution of update sql `c2c.string_value` for Chun's request (148). Closed ticket and set User Story to Complete
- follow-up with Askold's request for setting user (Gautam) with ELN and SUltra access
- created new user for Sharyanu with Biology group access
- Continue working on Ki constant sql calcs for Min (143) 
- call with Wall Street on hours in minutes after whole numbers, i.e. 7 hours 45 mins (multiple of 15 mins) - informed Dennis of situation
- Investigate and research about Bioregister string types and custom types to run SQL on ADC_BATCH_INFO table 

#### Sql queries from logs to investigate bioregister Complex string value type
