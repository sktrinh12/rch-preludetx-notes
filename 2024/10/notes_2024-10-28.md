- Email wall street for update on payroll status 
- Work on Ki value calc with `<,>` prefix logic
- Daily meeting with PreludeTx Team
- When DM responds, suggest 6am ET Weds for restart instead of weekend, if they didn't restart the server over the weekend
- Amy Crossan volunteered to upload test data for TF1 cell line data on DEV server and confirmed results appear as expected. Awaiting next day to migrate code to PROD and close in DevOps board
- Investigate AutoTasks API docs, since Jeff & Askold will be providing access to the platform for creating and submitting IT tickets
- DM response about 138 bug necessitates upgrade to version 6.2. A test environment was created @ `https://prelude-upgrade6.dotmatics.net/` and re-configured by Zifo, however the link doesn't work. The upgrade will be planned to be done end of year. 
- Quincy request (#149) to change chemical structure for PRT1981? (missing numeric digits in front?) he sent a cdxml file that I cannot open in Outlook webclient, nor can I open in sharepoint, from the direct link. Requested access, but awaiting approval.
    * convert from cdxml to mol file
    * update molfile column (CBLOB) for PRT1981 
    * ```sql
        select * from c$pinpoint.reg_data
        where formatted_id like 'PRT%1981';
        -- from view 
        select * from reg_batches_vw 
        where formatted_id = 'PRT1001981';
      ```
