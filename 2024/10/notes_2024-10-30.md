- test paste multiple PRT #'s into Bioregistry which has same functionality as Registery 2.0
    * there is a `ADC_bioreg_id` pop-up for the PRT-XXXX paste field to allow clickable PRT #s that lead to the bioregister complex information page: `https://prelude.dotmatics.net/bioregister/complex/show/{PRT_NUMBER}`
    * exists on Registry 2.0; but has a teal coloured label
    * the backend view used is `ADC_TARGET_VW`
    * there is a validation sql for the label in the Registry 2.0 of the multifield paste box: 
    ```sql
    SELECT 1
      FROM dual
      WHERE NOT EXISTS
          (SELECT max(query_id) AS id
           FROM ds3_appdata.user_queries
           WHERE project_id= 86000
             AND form_id=526);
    -- form id info
    SELECT *
      FROM ds3_appdata.project_forms
      WHERE form_id = 526
      AND project_id = 86000;
    ```
    * this is Gateway_v1 project form name
    * Inner query returns nothing/NULL → Outer query returns 1.
    * Inner query returns something (non-null) → Outer query returns nothing.
