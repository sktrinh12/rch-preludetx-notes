- Capture how frequently each Browser project is visited along with Gateway and Inventory  
- in DEV server when clicking Browser module see this in logs: `STDERR - java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-01722: invalid number` 
    * related to: 
    ```sql 
    select * from ds3_appdata.U_F_O_ATTRIBUTES;

    order by time_stamp desc;
    ```

#### User Story #151
```sql
SELECT prop_value
  FROM ds3_userdata.tm_protocol_prop_lookup
  WHERE prop_type='CELL_LINE'
  ORDER BY prop_value
```
- Go to Studies -> Calculations, Dictionaries, Admin -> Dictionary -> Prop, then add new Property, `CELL_LINE` and value
- use R ggplot to plot statistics from export of TMP_PROJ_USAGE csv file; create jupterlab notebook to visualise data
