#### User story 153 KAT6 Browser Summary page modifications
- need to query first on KAT6 project, then click `KAT6 Project` purple button on LHS
- Need to calculate HC Response
- `% response at HC` typically refers to the percentage of the maximum response observed at the highest concentration (HC) of a test substance. Essentially, it measures the efficacy or potency of the substance being tested by comparing the response at the highest concentration to the maximum possible response.
- Investigate what resp HC is:
```sql
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM USER_TAB_COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'SUMM_JAK2'
AND COLUMN_NAME LIKE '%RESP%'
ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME
```
- After clicking KAT6A project within a query, the `Cell Viability` section at bottom uses: `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` view
- On main KAT6A project under section: `Assay Data` -> ZR75-1 Cellular Data / 14-day Prolif / Hibit Data / Hibit Plasma sub-sections use the `SUMM_KAT6A`
- in `SUMM_JAK2` datasource, the resp_hc columns for most/all target compound combos reference presp_hc column which is (subquery table is, `DS3_USERDATA.JAK2_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`); this is the geometric mean calculation: 
```sql
power(10, avg(log(10, CASE
        WHEN response_at_hc > 0 THEN response_at_hc
        ELSE NULL
    END))) AS presp_hc,

-- two types of case stmt that reference t1 or t13 tables

-- t1
CASE
  WHEN t1.target = 'JH2 JAK1'
       AND t1.target_conc = '0.5 nM'
       AND t1.tracer = 'HY-102055'
       AND t1.tracer_conc = '50 nM'
       AND t1.p IS NOT NULL
       AND t1.r IS NOT NULL THEN t1.presp_hc
  WHEN t1.target = 'JH2 JAK1'
       AND t1.target_conc = '0.5 nM'
       AND t1.tracer = 'HY-102055'
       AND t1.tracer_conc = '50 nM'
       AND t1.p IS NOT NULL THEN t1.presp_hc
  WHEN t1.target = 'JH2 JAK1'
       AND t1.target_conc = '0.5 nM'
       AND t1.tracer = 'HY-102055'
       AND t1.tracer_conc = '50 nM'
       AND t1.p IS NULL THEN t1.presp_hc
END resp_hc_jh2_jak1,

-- t13
CASE
  WHEN t13.assay_type = 'AlphaLISA'
       AND t13.target = 'pSTAT5'
       AND t13.cell_line = 'TF-1'
       AND t13.time_hr = 2
       AND t13.p IS NOT NULL
       AND t13.r IS NOT NULL THEN t13.highest_concentration
  WHEN t13.assay_type = 'AlphaLISA'
       AND t13.target = 'pSTAT5'
       AND t13.cell_line = 'TF-1'
       AND t13.time_hr = 2
       AND t13.p IS NOT NULL THEN t13.highest_concentration
  WHEN t13.assay_type = 'AlphaLISA'
       AND t13.target = 'pSTAT5'
       AND t13.cell_line = 'TF-1'
       AND t13.time_hr = 2
       AND t13.p IS NULL THEN t13.highest_concentration
END hc_tf1
```

#### Notes on SUMM_JAK2 to understand the `response_at_hc` value

- The table, `IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY` has a pivot:
```sql
PIVOT 
( 
    MAX(IC90) FOR NAME IN (
        '% Max Response' AS Max_Response, 
        'Absolute IC50' AS Absolute_IC50, 
        'Highest Concentration (µM)' AS Highest_Concentration, 
        '% Response @HC' AS Response_at_HC
    ) 
) PVT
```
- MAX(IC90):
    * This part tells Oracle to take the maximum value of `IC90` for each unique `NAME` value. The `MAX` function is used as the aggregation method because each new column created by the pivot needs a single value per row
    * `IC90` is the `RESULT` value of the `t8` table, `DS3_USERDATA.SU_DERIVED_RESULTS`
    * There are 4 unique values for `NAME`: that the `PIVOT` account for. Each distinct value in `NAME` will become a new column in the output
    * Each of these columns will contain the `MAX(IC90)` value where the `NAME` matches the specified value

- Suppose we start with data in `t` that looks like this (simplified):

| experiment_id	| NAME |IC90|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|	% Max Response|	85|
|1|	Absolute IC50|	20|
|1|	Highest Concentration (µM)|	100|
|1|	% Response @HC|	75|
|2|	% Max Response|	90|
|2|	Absolute IC50|	25|
|2|	Highest Concentration (µM)|	150|
|2|	% Response @HC	|80|

- When we apply the PIVOT operation, this table transforms to:

| experiment_id	| Max_Response|	Absolute_IC50|	Highest_Concentration|	Response_at_HC|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|1|	85|	20|	100|	75|
|2|	90|	25|	150|	80|

- get protocol names:
```sql
select DISTINCT(PROTOCOL_ID), PROTOCOL from TM_PROTOCOLS WHERE PROTOCOL_ID IN (341,
361,
382,
402,
406,
421,
441,
461,
542,
543,
544,
561,
562)
ORDER BY PROTOCOL_ID
```

- changed: 
`KAT6A_ICW_REGISTRY_SUMMARY, KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY, SUMM_KAT6A, KAT6A_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`
