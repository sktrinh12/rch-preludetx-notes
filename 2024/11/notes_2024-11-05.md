## 📝 Day 22, Tuesday - `notes_2024-11-05.md`

- continue with #154
- created local git repo of altered/edited SQL files from DEV and PROD datasources

#### Understand `SUMM_KAT6A` query:
- First subquery that contains the calculated physical characteristics:
```sql

```

- this query selects the distinct names from T9 derived analyses table. There seems to only be about 6 different types. If there is no name, there won't be an affiliated response at HC value
- This shows the only types of names available, seems like the `Absolute DC50` is not used for KAT6A nor `IC10` and `IC90`
- ```sql
    select distinct(name) from DS3_USERDATA.SU_DERIVED_ANALYSES
    ```
|NAME|
|-----|
|% Max Response|
|% Response @HC|
|Absolute DC50|
|Absolute IC50|
|Highest Concentration (µM)|

- within the `KAT6A_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` view, if we use this as the based join table: `INNER JOIN IC50_RESULTS_SUMMARY  b ON a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id`, the KAT6A_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY view will have about 13977 rows in total and 66 rows that have valid (non-null) `RESPONSE_AT_HC` values
- Otherwise, using `IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY` on the join will result in 99 rows, with valid `RESPONSE_AT_HC` values
- This is because `IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY` has: `AND T4.PROTOCOL_ID IN (542, 543, 544, 561, 562)` in the WHERE CLAUSE whereas the other has no WHERE CLAUSE
- But, need to bring in PERCENT_INHIBITION into `IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY` in order to run `KAT6A_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`

## Using Git for SQL Query Management in Dotmatics

### **1. Version Control**: Track changes to SQL queries over time, allowing easy reversion to previous versions if errors occur.
![Version Control](https://cssanimation.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Collaboration-in-Code-Management-1536x977.jpg)

### **2. Collaboration**: Enable team members to work simultaneously on queries, reducing conflicts and enhancing accountability through clear ownership.
![Collaboration](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Cb2WlVRiO3csejByQUOiIQ.png)

### **3. Quality Assurance**: Implement a review process for changes to catch errors early and ensure high-quality queries through testing.
![QA](https://d2ds8yldqp7gxv.cloudfront.net/Blog+Explanatory+Images/Quality+Assurance+Plan+1.webp)

### **4. Documentation**: Maintain a detailed audit trail with commit messages and inline comments for better context and understanding of changes.
![Docs](https://git-scm.com/images/branching-illustration@2x.png)

### **5. Integration**: Support automated testing and deployment of queries within CI/CD pipelines, improving workflow efficiency.
