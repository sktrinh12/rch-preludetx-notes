## 📝 Day 23, Wednesday - `notes_2024-11-06.md`

- Write git version controlled SQL statements for `SUMM_JAK2` datasource in PROD
- Meeting with Genaro, discussed DM6 upgrade and git versioning; screenshare of `git diff`
    * suggested to leverage Azure DevOps git repo functionality
- Pushed local git edits of selected `.sql` files to `PreludeTx_Dotmatics_SQLDatasources`
- Added 2x `CELL_LINE` for PROD for US151
- Added commits to repo for `SUMM_JAK2` on DEV as well (they are slightly different at the moment)
- Impromptu meeting with Askold and Genaro about ASFU oracle license
