## 📝 Day 28, Wednesday - `notes_2024-11-13.md`

- daily meeting with Genaro
    * scientists uploaded new BI_NUC_UPLOAD but the truncation is happening still
    * 153 was approved by Min and will move to PROD
    * 152 was done on PROD and completed/closed on DevOps; however need to adjust the 0 padding as pointed out below
    * check 208392 study number from Nick Stahl to remove 0 padded IC50 relative value
    * 119 shows more data than desired, want to filter on Abcellera data only; realised didn't use the saved user query to only find bioreg ids based on those
    * move to PROD for 143/153 tickets; 143 needs to be adjusted to have Ki calculated: "For JAK2, we need Ki column for JAK2 JH2 WT, the calculation factor is 7.875"
- added Ki value for JH2 WT on DEV and PROD
- added the prefix/suffix column within the datasource configuration for SUMM_JAK2 to address 143. This uses the CS_ (conditional status) column to add the > or < sign in front of the numeric value
- Pushed changes to PROD for 153. There was strange hiccup with MSR table in KAT6A project, since the table was cloned in the form layout, it might have corrupted it when changing the binding data. The datasource was missing in the selection menu. Solution was to update the datasource. 
- created two datasources in PROD just like DEV: 
    1. `KAT6A_CELL_VIABILITY_NO_HIBIT`
    ```sql
    select * from kat6a_registry_summary where assay_type <> 'HiBit' order by experiment_id desc
    ```
    2. `KAT6A_HIBIT_24HR_REG_SUMM`
    ```sql
    select * from kat6a_registry_summary where time_hr = 24 and assay_type = 'HiBit'
    ```

```sql
-- first attempt at making dynamic query
-- need to make this query dynamic since the LIST_TABLE_NAME changes
