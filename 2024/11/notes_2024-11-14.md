## 📝 Day 29, Thursday - `notes_2024-11-14.md`

- start on 154 request: ratio of Ki vaues @ 2hr time point
    * edit and testing on DEV version first
- `IC50_EXP_INFO` has 2 null padded rows for some reason. Not sure why
    * It has two of the exact same rows due to the UNION ALL
    * This is one of the subquery tables that provides the `time_hr` column for experimental data, however only the `JAK2_A_LISA_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` table seems to have it so far. `JAK2_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` does not have the time_hr column
    * Does trfret bioassay have a time point data? It only seems to have the incubation and pre-incubation
    * This shows whether the protocol has a time_hr or incubation/pre-incubation column:
    * ```sql
        select * from tm_prot_exp_fields_values
        where experiment_id = 215350 -- any experiment id
        ```
    * Genaro to confirm with Min what does time point at 2 hr mean in this request. `JAK2_A_LISA_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` shows `time_hr` and `JAK2_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` shows `PRE_INCUBATION` & `INCUBATION`
    * De-mystify the disappearing data from BI_NUC_UPLOAD; the mapping file was wrong. Data was sent to BI_NUC_UPLOAD_FMT mistakenly
- another follow up meeting with Genaro at 16:00 on Min's request
    * Re-wrote sql (DEV) for 143/154 Ki calcs since Min requested for tracer to be PRT based not HY based. Also added TF1 cell line to DEV `SUMM_JAK2` sql

- in order to change project id or code for a particular PRT#, go to register module -> LEGACY COMPOUNDS -> click `Batches` -> then search for ID by clicking (+) symbol and entering the ID on the bottom-most row then click the 'magnifying glass' -> go to the batch of interest and change the Project ID column as desired. This wasn't done by me but the reference US in DevOps is: #158

```sql
-- batch level
select a.reg_id, 
a.batch_id,
a.user_name,
a.formatted_batch_id,
b.project_name 
from c$pinpoint.reg_batches a
inner join c$pinpoint.reg_projects b ON a.project_id = b.id
where formatted_batch_id = 'PRT1000012-001'
;

-- compound level
select 
a.reg_id,
a.formatted_id,
a.project_id,
a.reg_date,
b.id,
b.project_name
from c$pinpoint.reg_data a
inner join c$pinpoint.reg_projects b on a.project_id = b.id
where a.formatted_id = 'PRT1000012'
;
```
