## 📝 Day 32, Tuesday - `notes_2024-11-19.md`

- Min wants the calc for ic50, dmax, sd, resp_hc to be calculated based off of only time_hr = 24 hr so need to re-visit sql in `SUMM_JAK2`
- 119 needs to remove the warhead, PRT1003404 from ds
    * partner only interested in experiment ids (data) that have more than 2-3 unique compound ids; and have PRT5 series
    * those that only have the PRT1003404 warhead would be excluded from the DS 
    * noticed the `CREATED_DATE` column was not being detected in the project DS; so casted it as `DATE` data type which fixed it
    * for some reason the data is not showing for PRT500343 and other similar ones that are very recent and have AbCellera antibody names
    * reference compound (PRT1003404) normally on first plate, but 3,4,5,6 plates have the other PRT5 series compounds
- third meeting at 15:15 about BI_NUC_UPLOAD_FMT table not showing data from upload
    * Genaro mentioned PRT1% compounds are not populating in DS, however upon querying in table browser, it shows 45k rows and provided experiment ids in DevOps board that shows PRT1% as first compound and PRT5% as remainders
- need to confirm on Min's request 154 KAT6A summary page that the cell viability table will not show HiBit data which is the current case

### 119 Abcellera test on further filtering based on new knowledge:
