taskId,Name
26690588,Platform / Dotmatics Support (OnGoing)
26690596,1on1 with Genaro
26690594,Internal Team Meeting

- work on 162 / 165
- for 162 just update on DEV and wait for data to be uploaded after thanksgiving 
- 160 + 165 are actually the same request

#### Investigate 165/160
- Seems like there is no data for TF-1 or SET2 in the CTG assay type datasource, jak2_registry_summary. On PROD these cell lines exist:
    1. K562 HiBiT
    2. HEL9217 (JAK2 HIBIT)
    3. HeLa-SMARCA2-HiBit
    4. HeLa-SMARCA4-HiBit

- On DEV only one exists: `Hela-HiBit-KAT6A`
- The underlying datasource, `SUMM_JAK2` for the JAK2-Degrader summary page has no data whatsoever for the following cell lines. That is, these tables have never be populated yet. 
    1. BAF3-TPOR-JAK2VF
    2. BAF3-TPOR-JAK2WT

- used this sql to check if there are non-null values on PROD for CTG assay:

```sql
SELECT 
    "IC50_NM_CTG_VF", "N_IC50_CTG_VF", "DMAX_CTG_VF", 
    "SPAN_CTG_VF", "SD_IC50_CTG_VF", "CS_IC50_CTG_VF", 
    "IC50_NM_CTG_WT", "N_IC50_CTG_WT", "DMAX_CTG_WT", 
    "SPAN_CTG_WT", "SD_IC50_CTG_WT", "CS_IC50_CTG_WT"
FROM 
    SUMM_JAK2
WHERE 
    COALESCE("IC50_NM_CTG_VF", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("N_IC50_CTG_VF", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("DMAX_CTG_VF", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("SPAN_CTG_VF", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("SD_IC50_CTG_VF", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("CS_IC50_CTG_VF", '') <> '' OR
    COALESCE("IC50_NM_CTG_WT", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("N_IC50_CTG_WT", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("DMAX_CTG_WT", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("SPAN_CTG_WT", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("SD_IC50_CTG_WT", 0) <> 0 OR
    COALESCE("CS_IC50_CTG_WT", '') <> ''
;
-- check distinct cell lines
select
    DISTINCT(cell_line) 
FROM ds3_userdata.jak2_registry_summary
;
```

- ask Dennis if I can stil log a full 8 hours if I take advantage of the half day (noon) on weds; also show him the markdown notes
