## 📝 Day 37, Tuesday - `notes_2024-11-26.md`

- log time 
- work on 160/165/164 for DEV
- 10:00 1on1 Genaro
- 14:00 1on1 Dennis

- need to design a python script to pull data from DM api to compare write_up column for cro masks
    * created new devops user story 167
    * compare the text from two DM instances (upgraded version 6 & older version 4)
    * issue with download API user guide since need DM license associated with Dotmatics support page, don't know how to download the pd user guide
    * there is a API_READ user created in User Admin settings. Genaro mentioned already a API token has been generated
    * no sample code or token received yet
- whilst investigating 162, found out that again DEV sql for `KAT6A_MSR_VW` is significantly different from PROD. There is a `UNION ALL` for the `kat6a_icw_registry_summary` table
- write email to Dennis about MySQL db issue that Prelude is facing; Michael wants to know if Prelude has any other requests other than DM
- need to do OMSR overall minimum significant ratio for the HiBit data US162; so far only did the ic50, sd, dmax, n, resp_hc, MSR
