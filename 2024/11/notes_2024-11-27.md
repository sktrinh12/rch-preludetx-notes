## 📝 Day 38, Wednesday - `notes_2024-11-27.md`

- 09:30 1on1 meeting with Genaro
    * discussed CRO masks issue-requested to write summary of solution since DM is hesitant to conduct any reparations
    * briefly discussed Azure MySQL database issue
    * 160/165 & 162 have been completed on DEV, awaiting testing with new data

#### Email on CRO masks:

> I decided to use this analogy of cooking based on a template recipe:
> 
> Imagine you're baking a cake using a recipe card, but instead of listing specific ingredients, the card uses placeholders like `<ingredient1>` or `<ingredient2>`. For example, it might say: 
> 
> Add 2 cups of `<ingredient1>` and 1 teaspoon of `<ingredient2>`
> 
> In your kitchen, you have a system (like Dotmatics) that automatically fills in these placeholders with the correct ingredients from your pantry: `<ingredient1>` becomes "flour," and `<ingredient2>` becomes "vanilla extract."
> 
> Now, imagine a third-party chef (Zifo) updates your recipe card but changes the placeholders to a new format your kitchen system doesn’t understand. Instead of `<ingredient1>` and `<ingredient2>`, the recipe now says {ingred 1} and {ingred 2}. Since your system doesn’t recognize these new placeholders, it leaves question marks (???) where the ingredients should be, so your recipe now reads:
> 
> Add 2 cups of ??? and 1 teaspoon of ???
> 
> Similarly, in Dotmatics, the placeholders like {{9:uid 6}} tell the system what information to display (like a reagent or product name). When the format of these placeholders changes, the system can’t recognize or fill them in, so it shows ??? instead.

> Explaining the SQL Solution
> This SQL query is designed to fix placeholders in experimental write-ups stored in a database. It is possible that the placeholder format used in Dotmatics has changed over different versions, and older placeholders are no longer recognized by the system. For example, placeholders like `{{8:row 123}}` or `{{9:uid 456}}` need to be updated to a new format like `{{1072:uid 123}}` or `{{1082:uid 456}}`. This query systematically updates these outdated placeholders in the database so they render correctly in the Dotmatics application.
> Here’s what’s happening, step by step:
> Pattern Matching and Replacement: The query uses a series of `REGEXP_REPLACE` (regular expression replace) functions to find placeholders in the old format and replace them with placeholders in the new format.
> For instance, `{{8:row 123}}` becomes `{{1072:uid 123}}`.
> Targeting Specific Entries: The WHERE clause ensures that only write-ups related to specific experiments and protocols (IDs 481 and 501) are updated, so the change is focused and does not affect unrelated data. These IDs refer to CRO_Affinity_Wilmngton and CRO_Affinity_Wuhan protocols.
> Preserving the Core Data: This operation only updates the formatting of placeholders; the scientific content of the write-ups remains untouched.
> Why This Isn’t Tampering or Data Alteration
> The SQL query is not altering the actual experimental data or scientific results. Instead, it:
> Updates how the data is referenced in the system (via placeholders) to ensure compatibility with the current version of the platform.
> Maintains the integrity of the write-ups, as only the format of the placeholder variables is adjusted, not the content or meaning of the text.
> Concerns about auditability and data traceability:
> The audit trail only shows something like this, this is a real sample from the audit trace:
> 
> ```bash
> preludeadmin
> 2024-10-16 09:41:44
> updated experiment writeup: <p>acetyl acetate;4-aminophenol (316.83 mg, 1.5 mmol, 35% yield) The reaction was concentrated to dryness and the residue was taken up in EtOAc ( ml) and the organics washed with 2 x ml water then 1 x ml saturated brine solution. The organics were then separated and dried (MgSO4) before concentration to dryness. The crude was then purified by flash column chromatography eluting %EtOAc in Isohexane. The desired fractions were concentrated to dryness in vacuo.2,4-dichloro-5-(difluoromethyl)pyrimidine ( mg, 2. mmol) &nbsp;1-(2-amino-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)-2-methylpropan-2-ol (694.17 mg, 4.03 mmol) &nbsp;1,4-Dioxane (2 mL) &nbsp;</p>
>```
>
> The only details being logged are the ISID (username), a timestamp of the action, and the changes made—in this case, the experiment write-up and its text. This process can be replicated through a carefully written SQL query, mimicking the system's behind-the-scenes operations to maintain compliance with the audit trail. As a result, there will be no negative impact on the system or data integrity.

- work on python script
- would like to be in jupyter notebook for presenting to team
- during investigation, noticed there are masks views stored in db:
    * `ELN_PRODUCTS_RXN_SCREENIN_MASK`
    * `ELN_REAGENTS_RXN_SCREENIN_MASK`
    * `ELN_SOLVENTS_RXN_SCREENIN_MASK`
    * `TM_TEXT_MASKS_USER`
    * `ELN_REAGENTS_MASK`
    * `TM_TEXT_MASKS`

#### sql to determine ds id project id for api call:
```sql
SELECT
    p.project_id,
    e.ds_id,
    e.name,
    e.table_name,
    p.description
  FROM ds3_appdata.data_sources e
  JOIN
    (SELECT
       project_id,
       description
     FROM ds3_appdata.projects) p ON p.project_id = e.project_id
  WHERE e.name like 'ELN_W%'
```

- use of postman to run API call to determine the write-up data:
```bash
https://{{Domain-Dev}}.{{base_url}}/browser/api/data/strinh/68000/531/138443?token=GMOK2-80DZT-3UN8R-2F5Y7-YQ8EU
```

- the mask for products is
    * {PRODUCT_NAME} ({QUANTITY} {QUANTITY_UNITS}, {MMOL} mmol, {YIELD}% yield)
- the mask for reactants is
    * {REACTANT_NAME}​({QUANTITY}​,{MMOL} mmol)​
- the mask for solvent is
    * {SOLVENT_NAME} ({VOLUME} {VOLUME_UNITS})
