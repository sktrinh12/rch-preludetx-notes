## üìù Day 44, Monday - `notes_2024-12-09.md`

- 1on1 Genaro
    * work on ppt slides to presetnt idea on cro mask comparison 
    * PreludeLX01 server on ivanti for running CRo masks analysis and jupyter notebook, Postgresql, click on remote control to access
    * ABCELLERA data export wants to include: protocol, cell line, target
    * issue with 165 IC50 SD and N columns not populating for the two expt ids
    * for 159 need to find all active screening protocols in last year: pivot on protocol
    * for 159, add note on side

- bash command to count the number of exp ids in file:

```bash
 tr ',' '\n' < ~/Documents/RCH/exp_ids_eln_writeup_compr.txt | grep -v '^$' | wc -l
# 7318
```

- re built sql datasources for all three instances, also created intermediary table `TMP_ELN_WRITEUP_MASK_PLH_PROT` for dev and up6 created diff project
    * after trying again to fetch api for prod, it was returning empty json payload so created the same project and exposed just the one DS, and it seemed to work after this
    * can use table view in DM, however the render has mixed colours and font sizes, a little difficult to read
    * render all three writeups from 3 DM instances; doesn't seem to show major differences in mask_id/unique_id as expected. Only issue was the use of QUANT for reagents
- changed Dockefile to not use `dump.sql` and upload all `TMP_ELN_WRITEUP_API_SRC` to psql database

- For US165 test subquery:
    * turns out the assay_type is HiBit in jak2_registry_summary and the data from 215448 has assay_type='CellTiter-Glo'
so the data won't show up as expected. Need to clarify what should be the assay type for this experimental data. JAK2_REGISTRY_SUMMARY has never been modified by me; there is no Git log of this sql.
