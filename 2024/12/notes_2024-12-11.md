## 📝 Day 46, Wednesday - `notes_2024-12-11.md`

- check US160 PRT1008629 #
- pull reagent and product tables stacked vertically to left of U6, CLONE, PROD html renders 
- ivanti setup and access completed with preludetx IT
- 274 - SMARCA dual; 254 SMARCA2
    * want smarca summary page to be able to view the data from project 274
