## 📝 Day 47, Thursday - `notes_2024-12-12.md`

- investigate 176 again  
- worked on 162 (MSR/OMSR for hibit 24 hr data) & 160 (TF-1 and SET2 agg data)
- 1on1 meeting
    * justin kuriani is running smarca2 hibit cell viability assay today so will have experiment affiliated with PRT# from project code 274; related to US176
    * Genaro said to expense chatgpt subscription and if rch won't do it, bill it to Genaro
    * need to re-think the ELN comparison (167) use of beautiful soup4 to scrape html and render into jupyter notebook
    * the full XPATH of writeup in ELN CHEM NEW is: `/html/body/div[5]/form/table/tbody/tr/td/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/div[38]/table/tbody/tr/td/span/p[1]`
    * the run query button XPATH: `/html/body/main/div/section[1]/div/a[2]`
    * the LNB (exp id) input box XPATH: `/html/body/main/div/section[2]/div/div/div[2]/div/div[1]/form/table/tbody/tr/td/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/div[7]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/input[2]`
    * the url: `https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/query/query.jsp?currentMode=query&currentProjectID=83000`
    * check proliferation data in JAK2-Degrader project (Assay Data Summary page) - showing up CTG in HIBIT table
    * the project ids for the placeholder masks issue are: 501, 521, 481, 522, 261, 81
- sql to get exp ids from affected CRO protocols for US167:

| ID  | Name                    | Description               |
|-----|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 501 | CRO_Affinity_Wilmington | CRO ChemELN               |
| 481 | CRO_Affinity_Wuhan      | CRO ChemELN               |
| 521 | CRO_Affinity_Wuhan      | CRO ChemELN (not exist, or no placeholders present)   |
| 522 | CRO_Medicilon_Shanghai  | CRO ChemELN (not exist, or no placeholders present)   |
| 261 | CRO_Viva_ChemELN        | CRO ChemELN               |
| 81  | ChemELN                 | Dotmatics Chemistry ELN   |
