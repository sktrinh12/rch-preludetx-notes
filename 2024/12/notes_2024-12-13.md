- US177 missing KAT6A biochemical data in summary agg tables
    * might be due to zifo adding MSR values
    * needs to show up agg data
    * shows in assay data tr fret data
    * issue with cofactor_conc value and (t15.d) n_ic50_kat6a

    * Genaro shared list of 274 project code PRT#
    * investigate how to share in SMARC2 project summary page
    * expt is project code 254 related, but they want to somehow cross-share so they see agg calcs in the SMARC2 project

- US167 python api
    * discovered to use iframe to parse the proper html for the writeup text
    * use of direct iframe url link to get to studies page; there are two nested iframes
    * cannot use ELN CHEM NEW project to navigate to the writeup bc not all are shown in this, only CRO related, and even some exp ids don't show up for some reason, so must use studies instead
    * for protocol id 81, only 2 exp ids post date of 13-AUG-2024
    * for protocol id 481, 0 exp ids for post date of 13-AUG-2024
    * for protocol id 501, only 2 exp ids post date of 13-AUG-2024
