## 📝 Day 50, Tuesday - `notes_2024-12-17.md`

- work on US167 css styles for table in jupyterlab notebook
    * tried to use regex to add color coding of chemical reagents
    * only partial matches and partial coloring
- 1on1 with Genaro:
    * US180 - missing 'A' in antibody name CEACAM5 for Bioregister project
    * Need to work on 160 & 174 today

- for US160, the underlying issue was with `ic50_new_results_summary` DS, it was not including the cloned exp ids, this was due to the `STATUS` column which was only filtering for status = 1 (validated), but they were 'pending' status = 6; left joined on `su_statuses` to see the results

    WHERE
        c.protocol_id IN ( 544 ) and c.assay_type IN ('HiBit', 'CellTiter-Glo')
```

- the issue was the CellTiter-Glo part, removed this and the hibit table didn't show the same data anymore, the sql for both are very similar (Proliferation and Hibit)

#### US176 SMARCA2 summary page include project code 274
- investigated `SUMM_SMARCA2_NEW` which is the refernce DS for the SMARCA2 Assay Data table section
- in SUMM_SMARCA2_NEW, references to are noticable:
    * `smarca_deg_new`
    * `smarca2_registry_summary`
    * `smarca2_kinetic`
    * `smarca2_summary_vw`
- within `smarca2_summary_vw` change the project code to have 274 as well
- tested on PROD and seems to work

```sql
-- SMARCA2_SUMMARY_VW

WITH t AS
    (SELECT
       formatted_id,
       to_number(substr(formatted_id, 4, 7)) reg_data,

       row_number() over(PARTITION BY formatted_id

     FROM assign_proj a
     JOIN c$pinpoint.reg_projects b ON a.project = b.id
     WHERE project IN (254, 274))
  SELECT
    formatted_id,
    reg_data,
    project_name,
    reg_date
  FROM t
  WHERE r = 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
