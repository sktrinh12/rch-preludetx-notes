- `assign project` project tables/vws
    * assign_proj
    * project_list
    * on DEV within ASSAY_REQUEST project and click 'form' and Assign Project
    * not sure what this purpose serves bc it is siloed and standalone can't really relate to SU tables
    * the `Confirm` button triggers a JSP [link](https://documentation.dotmatics.com/br/6.2/admin-guide/admin-appendix/jsps)
        * `/browser/custom/runactionsql.jsp?primary=-PRIMARY-&colnameedited=UPDATE_DATE&dsid=12345&proj=93000`
    * the iframe shows URL: `/browser/process/adhocVertical.jsp?compact=true`
        * >Standard tool used to attach files and notes to an experiment; out of the box this is used in the Studies Notebook for Biology.
        * > Can add ?formonly=true to the end to restrict content to the files uploaded from that form. If there is more than one adhoc (file upload) tab in a protocol, then when users upload files to one of the tabs, it does not go to the others.  Files will only be on the tab they were uploaded to.

>JSPs (JavaServer Pages) contain additional system features that can be accessed to perform certain tasks. They can be used in pop-ups and iframes to link parts of the system together, e.g. opening more information on a selected item or registering compounds from Studies Notebook. 

> Many of the JSPs can be passed additional information that affects how they work, such as a sample or experiment identifier that could be dynamically built by the system (see Popups tab for more information).

>Some JSPs can be accessed by navigating through the system (e.g. the Studies homepage is actually /browser/testmanager/main.jsp which can be seen in the address bar of the internet browser). Others can be automatically linked by adding pop-ups and clicking the URL link.

>Below is a list of many of the JSPs available in the system and their intended uses. There are others, many of which may be found by browsing normally through the system.

-- c$pinpoint.reg_projects has 32 rows and tm_experiments (with WHERE clause) has 46 rows, the resulting table will have 32 * 46 = 1472 rows
-- The result will be a Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning each row from c$pinpoint.reg_projects is joined with every row from tm_experiments
