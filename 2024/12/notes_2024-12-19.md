## üìù Day 52, Thursday - `notes_2024-12-19.md`

- 1on1 Genaro @ 10:00
    * explained work for 176/160
    * screening scientist may want to re-do the abcellera data export

- sql validation in Label of Registry 2.0 (ID Paste Box):
```sql
SELECT 1 FROM DUAL WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT MAX(QUERY_ID) AS ID FROM DS3_APPDATA.USER_QUERIES WHERE PROJECT_ID= 86000 AND FORM_ID=526)
```

- within the lookup field in table properties, double click on white entry box to open a sql editing box, each one is indexed by an integer and has specific sql that executes to populate the 'select' tag which is a custom lookup:
    * the actual lookup sql used is a union all of 1 & 2; supposedly to run both lookup sql form 1 and 2
    * need to set table settings like so to have drop-down to work: enable delete=false, single row editing=true, enable replication=false, editable=true
    * assuming that allow editing will append and/or replace the row that is currently set from REG_DATA_VW (PROJECT_NAME) with that of the sql from the lookup (index 0)

```sql
SELECT PROJECT_NAME  FROM (SELECT REG_ID,FORMATTED_ID,PROJECT_ID,PROJECT_NAME FROM REG_DATA_VW
UNION ALL 
SELECT distinct to_number(substr(a.formatted_id ,4,7)) as reg_id, a.formatted_id, a.project, b.project_name from assign_proj a join reg_data_vw b on a.project=b.project_id)
WHERE FORMATTED_ID='PRT1009207' -- ? use of question mark placeholder
;

-- can also use this join to get same info:
SELECT 
a.experiment_id,
a.formatted_id,
a.project,
b.project_name
 from assign_proj a
join  c$pinpoint.reg_projects b on a.project = b.id  
WHERE FORMATTED_ID='PRT1009207'
;

select "FORMATTED_ID", "PROJECT_NAME", "C", "REG_DATE"  from DS3_USERDATA.REG_DISPLAY_VW  where FORMATTED_ID in ('PRT1009207', 'PRT1009162') 

;
select * from multi_projects_vw
where formatted_id IN (
'PRT1009207',
'PRT1009162'
)
;
```

- investigate why in JAK2-degrader project summary page it seemingly shows both JAK2-degrader and JAK2 (inhibitor) PRT#s; users asked why it is not as simple for SMARCA2
    * below sql shows that since prt#s have 1-to-1 relationship with expids thus the underlying DS can use a simple WHERE clause like, `WHERE project_code IN (264, 266)`
    * this pivoted data below shows diff exp ids for each project name (code)

```sql
select * from 
ic50_exp_info
where project_name_ro in ('JAK2')
;
```

- worked on US160 
    * created new DS dedicated to hibit; replciation of JAK2_REGISTRY_SUMMARY, called JAK2_HIBIT_REGISTRY_SUMMARY
    * only difference is the where clause to include CTG data
    * removed BAF3-TPOR-JAK2WT and BAF3-TPOR-JAK2VF from CTG table section on DEV as requested by Preludetx

- worked on US162 - KAT6A
    * added OMSR column in DEV and bounded data column

- research about jupyterhub server
    * first created new user on wsl:

```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 -u root
adduser strinh 
usermod -aG sudo strinh 
su - strinh
sudo apt update
```
