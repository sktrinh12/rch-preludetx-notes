## 📝 Day 57, Friday - `notes_2025-01-03.md`

- worked on US177:
    * even after create the `kat6a_alt_registry_summary` and refactoring below sql to CTE version, the result was the same
    * the theory is that the PRT# needs to have more than 6 repeats (c, or count >= 6)
    * also the order_by needs to be between 1-6
    * in the end, did not use `kat6a_alt_registry_summary` DS; request to upload replica datasets for particular PRT# in order to calculate the MSR

#### US176 - SMARCA2 investigation of PRT#'s

- investigating each and every one of the PRT#'s and discovered that they didn't show up because of status (invalidated or knocked out) and in the case of PRT1011945 & PRT1011907 & PRT1011838, it was part of project code 270 (anti-PSMA/SMARCA DAC)
