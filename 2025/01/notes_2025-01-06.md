## üìù Day 58, Monday - `notes_2025-01-06.md`

- 1on1 Genaro:
    * push US162 to production
    * US162 & US177 use some of the same DS's
    * PRT 7160 for example test; concern that MSR & OMSR have similar values
    * US177 needs to update the sql for OMSR on DEV

- started making edits for US162 PROD sql DS

- downloaded jupyterhub thru on discoix:
    * couldn't find original install of jupyterhub, turns out it's because i was using TLJH distro from before
```bash
# this is the bloated version (NOT TLJH)
# not using this
docker run -p 8000:8000 -d --name jupyterhub quay.io/jupyterhub/jupyterhub jupyterhub
```

- but better to use: 
    * TLJH is not supported by docker, but is easier to install and maintain
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-dev git curl
curl -L https://tljh.jupyter.org/bootstrap.py | sudo -E python3 - --admin <admin-user-name>
# Login using the admin user name you used in step 3. You can choose any password that you wish
```

- server IP: http://172.21.207.92/
    * this is actually the WSL ip
    * the real ivanti ip is 172.16.244.233
    * still can't ping server ip from lab-gen-1 machine (172.16.246.145)
- If you would do sudo /opt/tljh/hub/bin/python3 -m pip install <something> you would end up installing something in the hub environment, and that would not be available in the system‚Äôs Python environment or the user environment.
- If you would do sudo /opt/tljh/user/bin/python3 -m pip install <something>, or from a user server‚Äôs terminal do sudo -E pip install <something> you would end up installing something in the user environment, and that would not be available in the system‚Äôs Python environment or the hub environment.
    * these commands don't work, rather `sudo pip install <pkg>` works on the admin account
    * must use `localhost` for docker container (psql) on jupyterhub, else use the docker container IP: 172.17.x.x

- test user on TLJH:
    * test
    * test12345
    * `https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/`
    * `https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub`
    * `https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/provider-specific-setup/providers/azuread.html`
    * use of 6500 port since jupyterhub uses 80 port, for pgadmin:  `docker run -p 6500:80 -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=discoix@preludetx.com' -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=prelude' -e 'PGADMIN_CONFIG_ENHANCED_COOKIE_PROTECTION=True' -e 'PGADMIN_CONFIG_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=10' -d dpage/pgadmin4`

- found oauth azuread github: `https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/tree/main/examples/azuread`
