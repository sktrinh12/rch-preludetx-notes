## üìù Day 59, Tuesday - `notes_2025-01-07.md`

- internal meeting /w Genaro and IT guy from preludetx about win11 server jupyterhub access for other computers
    * wsl virtualised ip needs to be receiving network traffic forwarded from win11 

```bash
# ran on windows server as admin
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=172.16.244.233 listenport=80 connectaddress=172.21.207.92 connectport=80
```

- then add new port inbound rule in microsoft windows defender firewall (TCP 80)
    * ensure jupyterhub was being served on 0.0.0.0, listens on all interfaces, including the virtualised WSL interface

- record screen capture using Loom, tried to install Kazam / SimpleRecorderScreen but did not work
    * send url to view video to Genaro thru email
    * testing link on the ivantai lab machine
- 1on1 with Dennis 10:00
    * shared wireframe of DM+API+SQL+JUPYTER analysis pipeline
    * shared story about Genaro comparing my metric of completed task/bi-weekly compared to Zifo and Astrix
- 1on1 with Genaro 11:00
    * presented demo of jupyterhub to genaro
    * expressed concern about uniqueness of exp ids. wants to ensure reviewers do not get duplicates
    * wrote python script that parses the exp_id folder and checks for global duplicates; did not find any (found 2 but because it was used in another test file that i later deleted from local folder; ran same test on preludex01 discoix machine by opening terminal and running `python check_dups.py`)
    * the sql used to generate random exp ids: [notes_2024-12-12](../../2024/12/notes_2024-12-12.md#sql-code-generate-exp-ids-section)
    * re-visited this sql to ensure robustness. checked out okay. The function `DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE` generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1 for each row.
When used in the `ORDER BY` clause, it assigns a random value to each row and sorts the rows by those random values, effectively shuffling the rows 
    * need to create 6x user names: chemist1-6 on jupyterhub
    * need to run `notebook_share.sh` after the users have logged in for the first time
    * Min and Genaro said US160/162 can be pushed to PROD
