## 📝 Day 60, Wednesday - `notes_2025-01-08.md`

- 1on1 with Genaro @ 11
    * initialize all jupyter accounts and use pre-determined passwords; chem175-X
    * need to push US160/US162 to PROD
    * initialisation of accounts show the shared drive; so the /etc/skel shared data worked; needed some restart or more time
- DM legal & senior engineer & Genaro & Raul meeting
- follow-up meeting with Genaro and Raul
    * discussed possibility of using just the alt writeup button 

#### US160
- made edits to corresponding sql ds for changes
    * ran into issue when updating binding columns on JAK2-degrader form: `ERROR: an error occured or you may not have access to perform this action, please contact an administrator`
    * after waited 2 hours it worked
    * noticed error in Systems about licensed seats have been exceeded
    * removed BAF3-TPOR cell line in CTG on PROD initially to be like DEV, however realised there was data in the DS, so replcaed them; in the process found this typo in the cell line: (should be `TPOR` not `EPOR`)
    * however, did not correct it yet

```sql
WHEN t5.assay_type = 'AlphaLISA'
 AND t5.target = 'pSTAT5'
 AND t5.cell_line = 'BAF3-EPOR-JAK2WT'
 AND t5.p IS NOT NULL
 AND t5.r IS NOT NULL THEN
t5.p
WHEN t5.assay_type = 'AlphaLISA'
 AND t5.target = 'pSTAT5'
 AND t5.cell_line = 'BAF3-EPOR-JAK2WT'
 AND t5.p IS NOT NULL THEN
t5.p
WHEN t5.assay_type = 'AlphaLISA'
 AND t5.target = 'pSTAT5'
 AND t5.cell_line = 'BAF3-EPOR-JAK2WT'
 AND t5.p IS NULL THEN
t5.r
END             ic50_nm_baf3,
```

- ran randomised ordering of exp ids for each of 4 CRO's again and replaced the txt files in `exp_ids` folder
    * however need to run scrape script again in order to grab data for each exp id
    * will probably grab 25 new exp ids for (after date), then append to the original date, that way you only scrape 25x3 times instead of (50+75) x 4
    * need to figure out sql that will select 25 new unique exp ids

#### workflow for US188:
- copied pasted the exp_ids for each protocol as below, in order to get the extra 25 exp ids after the zifo date: 


```sql

WITH main AS (
  SELECT *
    FROM tmp_affected_eln_writeup  
    WHERE protocol_id = 481
    AND experiment_id NOT IN (

```

- then ran python script to combine the previous exp_ids with the new 25, having `_combined_` prefix.
- then use a similar sql but with `NOT` keyword to grab only 75 total:
    * the exp ids in the `IN` statement was copied and pasted from the output of the `_combined_` prefix file
    * need to re-run webscrape on the `xtra` exp_ids

```sql
WITH main AS (
  SELECT *
    FROM tmp_affected_eln_writeup  
    WHERE protocol_id = 81
