## 📝 Day 61, Thursday - `notes_2025-01-09.md`

- create demo git repo to show why copying and pasting dev to prod is not the way to handle this and you lose the power of version control and history tracking of files
- work on US162
- work on US188 add 25 new exp ids for the eln writeup masks
    * there are no exp ids from up6 after zifo change date for ChemELN (81)
    * there are no exp ids from up6 after zifo change date for Wuhan (481); 200 exp ids are from before date
    * there are no exp ids from up6 after zifo change date for Wilmington (501); 50 exp ids are from before date
    * there are no exp ids from up6 after zifo change date for Viva ChemELN (261); 50 exp ids are from before
- emergency bug investigation on project code 267 not populating in dropdown list for ChemELN protocol
    * turns out it was in archive state (unclicked in Studies->Admin->project access)
    * also shows archived state in `TM_PROJECTS` table

#### US188 - run scrape script for new exp ids:
- changed `.env` file to have DB_HOST=localhost & changed `load_dotenv(override=True)` to load the .env over the set env vars in the terminal
    * also can delete the env vars
    * need to run the `compr_eln_writeup_scape.py` in windows env (PS terminal) from the `C:\Users\Disco-IX\Dotmatics%20Scripts\` directory

```bash
Remove-Item Env:DM_USER
Remove-Item Env:DM_PASS
```

#### Powershell commands to run on Win11 server (PreludeX01):
- these commands will add the 25 additional exp ids for each of the three cro protocols, since Viva_ChemELN doesn't have newer dates, it is not included
```bash
# wuhan
python .\compr_eln_writeup_scrape.py -n prod -e (Get-Content exp_ids/xtra/exp_ids_eln_writeup_prod_CRO_Affinity_Wuhan.txt -Raw)

# wilmington
python .\compr_eln_writeup_scrape.py -n prod -e (Get-Content exp_ids/xtra/exp_ids_eln_writeup_prod_CRO_Affinity_Wilmington.txt -Raw)

# chemeln
python .\compr_eln_writeup_scrape.py -n prod -e (Get-Content exp_ids/xtra/exp_ids_eln_writeup_prod_ChemELN.txt -Raw)
```

- after saved all new 75 exp ids to psql db, re-arranged `exp_ids` folder in script git repo to minimize code modification of the `.ipynb` file that will be used by chemists 
- looking into US177 - KAT6A page has no Biochemical screening data for any assays:
    * REF/MSR/OMSR doesn't show up bc needs inputted reference compound is now joining in the SUMM_KAT6A_(O)MSR DS
    * used template sql from DM support [docs](https://documentation.dotmatics.com/st/6.2/how-to-guides/how-to-make-datasources-to-view-screening-ultra-analysis-results)

```sql
