## üìù Day 62, Friday - `notes_2025-01-10.md`

- US177 - missing biochemical data - ref/msr/omsr not showing up due to reference compound 
    * the inner reference table, `TM_PROTOCOL_PROPS_PIVOT` uses max(decode()) but better to use PIVOT
    * it is grabbing reference compounds from the protocol property where the scientist enters at the beginning when creating the experiment
    * for example, exp id: `264137`, and reference_compounds: `PRT1006850` for the formatted_id: `PRT1012358` in the `4PL - Luminescence Cellular IC50` protocol

- packer training thru RCH 11:00-12:00
    * create custom AMI's for any machine, ec2, docker, vmbox, etc.
    * Ralph Carlisle - speaker/expert

- 1on1 /w Genaro:
    * clarified the issue with exceeded license seats that prevented modification of forms on PROD (US160)
    * discussed 177 where no reference_compounds and require N=6 to calculate MSR
    * completed US160/162
