## 📝 Day 63, Monday - `notes_2025-01-13.md`

- work on US156 - JAK2 Browser Page modification. Add UT-7 to Summary (Min - 9-JAN-25) 
    * DEV does not have UT-7 cell line to test
    * request scientist(s) to upload test data
    * added cloned table of AlphaLISA, IC50 (nM) Compound Data SET2,Duration 2; and named it UT-7 for preparation of datasource changes
    * remember to add compound status (cs_ict5) to add prefix to the datasource

    * ran eln chem search for JAR for usid and PRT#: PRT1012360
    * looked at reg_samples base table that shows the formatted_sample_id that matches this
    * showing batches and sample level

```sql
-- batch level
select * from reg_batches
where batch_id = 240596
 
;

-- sample id level
select * from reg_samples
where batch_id = 240596

;

-- compound level
select * from reg_data 
where reg_id = 1012403
;

```

- created new US190 for correction of PRT1012360 on DevOps board
- can change using sql update, but better to use Registry legacy tool
    * workflow: legacy register -> click (+) top right corner of Compound table -> search for ID = PRT1012360 (click magnifying glass) -> look below this table which is the batch level table -> click new batch and enter the information
    * once you create the new batch, you need to delete the 002 batch in the sample level
    * then register the same sample to batch 002 that was created

-- need to use this to get batch id in the custom string type of bioregister

select batch_id from adc_batch_info

-- explore what adc batch list
