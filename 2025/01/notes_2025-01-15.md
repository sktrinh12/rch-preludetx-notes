- US191 checkboxes for valid/invalid exp id export in jupyter notebook
    * chatgpt gave bogus code
    * found anywidget python package; however couldn't get simplest  example to work; installation was buggy
    * only other idea was to make backend service to update psql table
    * created flask backend service to update data and get data from psql

- 1on1 Genaro
    * focus on jupyter notebook updates

- DM meeting:
    * showed api using `...writeup/{{includeHtml}}"` syntax which seems unfamiliar
    * wrote test python script to output the differences
    * would need to re-engineer a bit in order to do a 'diff' between the DM instances

- follow-up meeting with Genaro based on new information and schedule from DM
