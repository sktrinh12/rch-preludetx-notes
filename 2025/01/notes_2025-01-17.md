## üìù Day 67, Friday - `notes_2025-01-17.md`

- US191
    * added new logic in jupyter notebook code to pre-populate the checkboxes if they had been checked from previous session (psql)
    * modularised the dropdown input for cro protocols (tidied up the user facing nbk)
    * these two ids from Wuhan cro had no writeup in db, but in DM showed writeup text:
        * 189721
        * 190827
        * 190943
    * the writeup was not empty but showed no content from the scrape:

```python
has_short_writeup = df['write_up'].str.len() < 50
df[has_short_writeup]['exp_id']
df[df.exp_id =='189721']['write_up']
# returns: <p style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp;</p> which has len() of 37
```

- to re-scrape these:
```sql
delete from eln_writeup_scrapped where exp_id IN (
'189721', '190827', '190943');
```
- then run:
```bash
python compr_eln_writeup_scrape.py -n prod -e 190827,190943,189721
```

- Ansible overview RCH meeting 11:00-12:00
    * don't use sudo
    * use tags such as: 
        * purpose (webserver, db, frontend)
        * OS
        * runtime (java, py, ruby, .net)
        * deploy type (green, blue)
        * database engine (mysql, psql)
        * environment (dev, prod, test, stage)
        * managed_by (ansible, tf, packer, manual)
        * application (foo, baz)
        * repo (url to repo storing ansible playbook and roles)

- Last minute 1on1 meeting with Genaro based on CAB meeting conclusions
    * tried to view pdfs from s3 bucket that were exported from DMX; however several were missing; not sure how data was exported
    * confirmed that PDF export logic/code is same as webpage rendering because the PDF export also contained the '?'
    * the pdfs didn't show the '?' but were not complete in regards to all possible exp ids
