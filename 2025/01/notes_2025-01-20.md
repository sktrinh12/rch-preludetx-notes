## üìù Day 68, Monday - `notes_2025-01-20.md`

- 1on1 Genaro:
    * for KAT6A project:
    * put (nM) in box for IC50
    * remove ZR75-1 cellular data; just remove the ZR75-1
    * DC50 value for SALL4-HIBIT also for Hibit/Hibit plamsma
    * for prod; add the SALL4 table below Hibit plasma table
    * new DM cloned instance: https://prelude-masks.dotmatics.net/browser/query/home.jsp?requester=favorite
        * not able to access; provided ip address to Genaro
    * move UT-7 in alphalisa in DEV

#### US193
- add kh_um_sm2 to the ds:
```sql
select ku_um_sm2 from summ_smarca2_new
```

#### US196
- change pdf config to show nM not in sci not
- need to edit the IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY.sql

```sql

-- show the <,> chars in the value
SELECT reported_result
FROM DS3_USERDATA.SU_ANALYSIS_RESULTS
WHERE substr(
      reported_result, 1, 1

#### US162 confirmation
- scientist mentioned that MSR/OMSR seems flipped, MSR having larger value:
- diff ran `diff PROD/KAT6A_OMSR_VW.sql PROD/KAT6A_MSR_VW.sql`

#### US197
- add new agg calcs for cell line:
```sql
SELECT
    tm.experiment_id,
    p.protocol,
    p.protocol_id,
    tm.property_name,
    tm.property_value
FROM ds3_userdata.tm_prot_exp_fields_values tm
JOIN ds3_userdata.tm_protocols p ON p.protocol_id = tm.protocol_id
WHERE tm.property_name = 'Cell Line'
and tm.property_value like 'LCLC%'
;

-- get ref compounds:

SELECT
    tm.experiment_id,
    p.protocol,
    p.protocol_id,
    tm.property_name,
    tm.property_value
FROM ds3_userdata.tm_prot_exp_fields_values tm
JOIN ds3_userdata.tm_protocols p ON p.protocol_id = tm.protocol_id
WHERE tm.property_name like 'Ref%'
and tm.experiment_id in (264198, 264776)
;

```
