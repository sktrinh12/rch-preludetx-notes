## üìù Day 69, Tuesday - `notes_2025-01-21.md`

- US194 - python script to call API and compare writeup
    * require access to newly cloned DM instance: prelude-masks
    * need query for DS that was generated for the API
    * this is the backup of the clone, which will not have changes, the first one with prelude-masks domain name will have the changes by the ~28th Jan: `https://prelude-prod-sdpo-8251.dotmatics.net/browser/login.jsp`

- US193 
    * duplicating table may not be good practice, since now you have duplicate DS in two projects
    * may need to use pop-up or some other method
    * duplicate table in KAT6A and call it SMARCA2 ref
    * after discussion, even though duplicating cross projects is not 'best practice' will be done in this situation for quick turnaround time. will open new ticket down the road for a better solution
    * perhaps use of pop-up sql to render a table similar to what is seen
    * column bindings: `VMAX_HR_1_SM2, VMAX_HR_1_SM2_SD, KU_UM_SM2, KU_UM_SM2_SD, VMAX_KU_UM_1HR_1_SM2, VMAX_KU_UM_1HR_1_SM2_SD, VMAX_HR_1_SM2_N`
    * discovered that can click 'cross-project' radio button when adding datasource. seems to make a view of it to share across projects, can click on edit cross projects to select what projects it shares with

- US197
    * add the LCLC-97TM1 cell line to PROD, no testing (Genaro mentioned this in meeting)

- US195
    * related to US193
    * SMARCA2 KINETIC mapping file exists in Nucleus
    * since the Kh value is what was desired, we can close both US195/193 since they were addressed by the appearance of the Kh value
    * issue with smarca2_kinetic table upload from nucleus, mis-join table
    * blanks from entry_ 503-1070
    * no DATE_ column filled so no way to check when was the upload

```sql 
select * from smarca2_kinetic
where entry_ < 550
order by entry_ desc
```

- US189 - bioregister batch #:
    * updated dev ops board on only option that I was able to find
    * created test on DEV

- US196 - pdf export sql
    * changed pdf config sql for:
        * 4PL - Luminescence Biochemical IC50 
        * 4PL - Luminescence Cellular IC50 
        * 4PL - Envision Biochemical IC50 
        * 4PL - Envision Cellular IC50 
        * 4PL - In-Cell Western IC50 
        * IC50 Cell Viability Assay 
    * IC50 Cell Viability Assay had a very different sql, added the rel ic50 nm case stmt from `IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY.sql`
