## 📝 Day 70, Wednesday - `notes_2025-01-22.md`

- US194 
    * able to access both DM cloned instances (backup and cloned) prelude-masks & sdpo-8251
    * however un-able to log into sdpo-8251
    * password saved as something else since it was from before AUG 2024

- BUG199
    * hibit plasma was showing in 'Cell Viabilty' table within KAT6A which should be below in the 'KAT6A Degradation' table
    * was due to where clause of only accounting for assay_type = 'HiBit'; changed to use `LIKE` clause; 

```sql
--KAT6A_HIBIT_24HR_REG_SUMM
select * from kat6a_registry_summary where assay_type like 'HiBit%'
;

--KAT6A_CELL_VIABILITY_NO_HIBIT
select * from kat6a_registry_summary where assay_type not like 'HiBit%' order by experiment_id desc
;
```

- US195
    * originally changed the CASE stmt to use LIKE keyword to capture the KAT6A and SMARCA2 strings for CELL_LINE, but during testing in the browser projects; the values never showed up; discovered bc projects filtered based on PRT# based on the `SMARCA2_SUMMARY_VW`; it will never show
    * thus, created new DS, `SUMM_KAT6A_KINETICS` with code snippet

    * added new DS for bioregister drop-down menu:
    * name is: `BI_PYLOAD_LINK_BATCH_IDS`
    * added new string type that uses the PARENT_BIOREG_ID dropdown
    * tested creating a new ADC BATCH; showed 3 drop down menus and changed order to be towards the top to closely resemble the original ask
    * problem is that the redundant dropdown menu is 'ugly' accoding to preludetx; not too happy with the solution; other solution is to ask DM for a more elegant solution
