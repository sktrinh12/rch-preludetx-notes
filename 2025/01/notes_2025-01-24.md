## üìù Day 72, Friday - `notes_2025-01-24.md`

- US194
    * created new ipynb file to analyse the similarity calculations as well as view the writeups from psql db
    * created python api script that uses scibert, if-idf and diff for comparing writeups; linked to psql

- RCH Terraform training @ 11:00 - 12:00
- DTX meeting 12:00-13:00
    * after meeting decision was to do a `diff` between the prod-sdpo-8251 instance vs. the cloned production and not what was originally planned prod vs cloned_after_change
    * for CRO Wilmington: returns a count 10875 of out 15732; that have potential problem-child writeups
    * use of this regex `%{{9:%`
    * will run diff and post to psql db
    * created project and 2 datasources for the API call on prod-sdpo-8251
    * plan to use the exp ids from `prod-sdpo-8251` instance since it is prior to 2024-AUG
    * DS_ID [DTX_EXP_STATUS_VW] = 1404
    * DS_ID [DTX_ELN_MASKS_SUMMARY] = 1403

```sql
--DTX_EXP_STATUS_VW
SELECT
    exp.protocol_id,
    exp.experiment_id,
    exp.created_date,
    exp.completed_date,
    exp.isid,
