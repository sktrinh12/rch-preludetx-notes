## üìù Day 73, Monday - `notes_2025-01-27.md`

- US194:
    * de-bug and check logs: `failed to raise connection for...` in DM instance and on prelude server: `aiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientConnectorError: Cannot connect to host prelude-prod-sdpo-8251.dotmatics.net:443 ssl:default [The semaphore timeout period has expired] `
    * checked task manager and seems like the prelude server is only at 62% CPU utilisation and 13GB memory at 62 concurrent tasks; originally set to 100

- 1on1:
    * Genaro confirmed that prelude network was hammered hard ~350 GB moved across network form 17:00-17:40
    * possibly the DM server can't handle too many connections as well
    * below is example of diff showing 40% similarity but sciBERT: 0.94 and TF_IDF: 0.60
    * restarted script again at 11:30 because realised the DS's are not sync'd prelude-prod-sdpo-8251 was looking at all project ids (87k) whilst the prelude-masks instance was looking at ~30k. changed datasource for both to be the same only looking at CRO Affinity experiments
    * after about ~30+ mins of running the amount was approximately: 5000 records and it errored the same again.
    * wrote email to Jeff from DM; responded with new HTTP POST request code snippet; had to re-write and re-factor existing code
    * added new logic to continue where left off; separate ds summary data retrieval and writeup retrieval
    * Genaro changed the type on the DevOps tasks for changing 4PL expts to use nM unit and not sci notation
    * asked for help to change purity for sample; showed in Register within `View Sample` link can change the purity within the column and clicked `Save changes` on DEV environment for: 303158 ID
    * checked on table browser and shows the proper changes for purity

```sql
select * from reg_samples
where id = 303158
