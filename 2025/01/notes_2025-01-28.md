## 📝 Day 74, Tuesday - `notes_2025-01-28.md`

- US194
    * script finished on win11 server (preludeX01) the morning after when checked at 08:00
    * guess-timating that finished script within 5-8 hours since first hour completed about 5000 records
    * checked psql pgadmin and saw all ~26k records for Affinity protocols
    * decided to use R to create the visuals
    * use of 3 visualisation methods: PCA, t-SNE, K-Means
    * firstly tried to run `docker exec -it ${docker_id} bash`; then run `apt update && apt install -y libpq-dev r-base-dev`
    * then enter `R` prompt and run: `install.packages("RPostgres", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")`
    * worked, but was not in the same R env, `/opt/conda/bin/R` but in the interactive docker bash it is: `/usr/bin/R` can use `Sys.which("R")` to determine path
    * tried `conda install conda-forge::r-rpostgres` in the jupyter terminal
    * followed by `install.packages("DBI") #needs >1.2.0` in juypter cell `packageVersion("DBI")` & `install.packages("FactoMineR")`
    * then, `conda install conda-forge::nlopt` - but still didn't work for FactoMineR
    * ran `docker exec -it -u root ${docker_id} bash` and `apt update & apt install cmake`
    * created new dockerfile with R commands incorporated
    * sql written to get records that have non-matching writeups

```sql
with t as (SELECT
    e1.exp_id,
    e1.system_name AS system_name_1,
    e2.system_name AS system_name_2,
    e1.write_up AS write_up_1,
    e1.summary_data AS summary_data_1,
    e2.write_up AS write_up_2,
    e2.summary_data AS summary_data_2,
    c.diff,
    c.match_percentage,
    c.scibert_score,
    c.tfidf_score,
    c.is_match
FROM
    ELN_WRITEUP_COMPARISON c
INNER JOIN
    ELN_WRITEUP_API_EXTRACT e1
    ON c.exp_id = e1.exp_id AND c.system_name_1 = e1.system_name
INNER JOIN
    ELN_WRITEUP_API_EXTRACT e2
    ON c.exp_id = e2.exp_id AND c.system_name_2 = e2.system_name
)
select * from t 
where is_match = 'false'

;
```

- 1on1:
    * discussed results from eln writeup comparisons
    * preludetx wants a visualization done to see the differences; they will do their own in parallel
    * created new US201
    * exported csv of all exp ids that need fixing and attached to US201 DevOps board
