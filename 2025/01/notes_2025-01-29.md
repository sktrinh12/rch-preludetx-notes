## 📝 Day 75, Wednesday - `notes_2025-01-29.md`

- US196
    * Updated PDF sql config for TR_FRET Functional Assay (441)
    * Uses the ICW - IC50 group analses for SU analyses
    * the PDF is different and was saved as `PDF_EXPORT_CONFIG_3.sql`

- US201
    * created dockerfile for jupyter notebook that has all R packages pre-installed
    * re-run all project_ids and create tables for each one
    * change DS to:
```sql
SELECT a.experiment_id FROM tm_experiments a 
join eln_writeup b on a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id
WHERE protocol_id IN (81,142,303,321,581,261,322)
and b.write_up is not null
```

- 1on1 Genaro:
    * run 10k on chemELN as a control for the same api script to see the difference metrics and compare to the prelude-masks vs sdpo-8251
    * ensure the psql db can handle more data:
    * ran this sql `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('prelude'));` which returned 116 MB
    * also ran below PS commands:
    * so there is plenty of space for new data to be inserted into the psql db
    * we need to check the ~2000 records that were greater than match_percentage > 95% to ensure they actually are legit matches

#### confirm matches
- sql used to confirm 686 records:
```sql
with t as (SELECT
    e1.exp_id,
    e1.system_name AS system_name_1,
    e2.system_name AS system_name_2,
    e1.write_up AS write_up_1,
    e1.summary_data AS summary_data_1,
    e2.write_up AS write_up_2,
    e2.summary_data AS summary_data_2,
    c.diff,
    c.match_percentage,
    c.scibert_score,
    c.tfidf_score,
    c.is_match
FROM
    ELN_WRITEUP_COMPARISON c
INNER JOIN
    ELN_WRITEUP_API_EXTRACT e1
    ON c.exp_id = e1.exp_id AND c.system_name_1 = e1.system_name
INNER JOIN
    ELN_WRITEUP_API_EXTRACT e2
    ON c.exp_id = e2.exp_id AND c.system_name_2 = e2.system_name
)
select * from t 
where is_match = 'true' and write_up_1 like '%?%'

#### US189 bioregister
- seems as though the ab drop down list needs to list all possible from protein_sample table
- i.e. `ADC is AB + PRT (payload-linker in reg 2.0)` & `ADC batch includes AB-001 + PRT-002`
 
- sql for testing:
