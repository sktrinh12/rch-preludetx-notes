## 📝 Day 75, Wednesday - `notes_2025-01-29.md`

- US196
    * Updated PDF sql config for TR_FRET Functional Assay (441)
    * Uses the ICW - IC50 group analses for SU analyses
    * the PDF is different and was saved as `PDF_EXPORT_CONFIG_3.sql`

- US201
    * created dockerfile for jupyter notebook that has all R packages pre-installed

- 1on1 Genaro:
    * run 10k on chemELN as a control for the same api script to see the difference metrics and compare to the prelude-masks vs sdpo-8251
    * ensure the psql db can handle more data:
    * ran this sql `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('prelude'));` which returned 116 MB
    * also ran below PS commands:
    * so there is plenty of space for new data to be inserted into the psql db
    * we need to check the ~2000 records that were greater than match_percentage > 95% to ensure they actually are legit matches

#### confirm matches
- sql used to confirm 686 records:
```sql
with t as (SELECT
    e1.exp_id,
    e1.system_name AS system_name_1,
    e2.system_name AS system_name_2,
    e1.write_up AS write_up_1,
    e1.summary_data AS summary_data_1,
    e2.write_up AS write_up_2,
    e2.summary_data AS summary_data_2,
