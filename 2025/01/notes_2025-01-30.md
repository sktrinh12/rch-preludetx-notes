## 📝 Day 76, Thursday - `notes_2025-01-30.md`

- US201:
    * run the remaining project ids (~60k) the obtain the similarity calcs to be saved on psql db
    * triggered run at 70 concurrent tasks but it failed again (same error)
    * throttled back at 60 and re-ran at 11:15
    * better psql sql to view data with joins and json interpreted data
    * errored for 3rd time (probably issue related to extended period of consecutive API calls ~2-3 hours); servers cannot sustain. Logs show same exact error

- US189:
    * all possible Antibody batch ids available
    * all possible payload linker batch ids available as well
    * discovered during meeting that the ab batch id and payload linker batch id are within the Parent Samples & Parent Chemical Samples inputs of the ADC Batch creation screen
    * want to re-name top (antibody batch) bottom (payload linker batch) - doesn't seem possible may be something in the config file on tomcat, thus DM would need to investigate
