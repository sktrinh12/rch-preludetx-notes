## üìù Day 78, Monday - `notes_2025-02-03.md`

- US204
    * created `alter_eln_write_psql_db.sql` file that adds analysis_date to schema
    * heavily modified the `compare_eln_writeup_dm_api.py` script to alter the for-loop structure and instead do a sql query instead of an api call for one and not the other

- 1on1:
    * need to add anlaysis column (date or number)
    * most likely date since it seems more future proof
    * run for fixed prelude-masks since DTX has done a fix on reagents, but not temperature

- DTX meeting:
    * send email with error logs from DTX and python stderr
    * genaro showed data analysis done on spotfire; trellis scatter plot if-idf vs match% for each protocol and coloured by range of match%
