## üìù Day 79, Tuesday - `notes_2025-02-04.md`

- no 1on1 today with PreludeTx
    * email from Genaro indicating that once temp and #REF! fixes are completed execute the script to get new similarity calculations
- 1on1 with Dennis RCH
    * show jupyter notebook work (cluster visualisation of match% vs if-idf)
    * show devops board and audit trail in git logs
    * show ivanti tool to remote into server

- US204:
    * searched for table where logs are stored:
    * results show: `DOTMATICS_APS_DEBUG_LOG, DOTMATICS_APS_ERROR_LOG`
    * noticed that these tables aren't related to `TM_EXPERIMENT_AUDIT` which is the default table that contains all audits
    * ERROR_LOG table is empty only DEBUG_LOG shows data
    * when looking at a exp id, click the `Info` tab then `Summary` tab and can view the audit trail (the mask changes are not included)

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME 
FROM ALL_TAB_COLUMNS 
WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'LOG_ID'

-- this matched one of the rows from the attached `mask_update_log.csv` files from DM
-- the experiment id = 194513
select * from DOTMATICS_APS_DEBUG_LOG
where log_id = 61274
```

- why is the python script slow? DM mentioned it was able to retrieve 10000 records in an hour
    * Larger Payloads: GET requests usually have minimal data (just URL parameters)
    * POST requests often include a body payload, increasing network transmission time
    * No Caching for POST: GET requests can be cached by browsers and servers, reducing repeated load times
    * POST requests cannot be cached by default, meaning every request goes to the server
    * the script is also NOT inserting a row into a PSQL database which significantly adds latency
    * the edited script also now fetches the writeup from the PSQL database for the comparison calculation
    * the edited script runs three separate PSQL executions (insert into API_EXTRACT, insert into COMPARISON, fetch writeup from API_EXTRACT)
    * the script runs 3 separate calcuations on the writeup pairs (diff, scibert, tf-idf)
    * added 100 ms sleep (await) for breathing room, but adds latency
    * ran a timed script of a slightly modified version of the DM python script; after 1843 requests (sequential) also errored (same error):

```bash
requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='prelude-prod-sdpo-8251.dotmatics.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /browser/api/data/testadmin/98000/1404_PROTOCOL,1404_PROTOCOL_ID,1404_ISID,1404_CREATED_DATE/253534 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002419180BD10>, 'Connection to prelude-prod-sdpo-8251.dotmatics.net timed out. (connect timeout=None)'))
```
- the average api fetch time for the unmodified python script is: 0.190511 seconds calculated by:
```bash
awk -F',' 'NR>1 {sum+=$3; count++} END {if (count > 0) print sum/count}' dm_api_fetch_times.csv
```


- sample output of 255992 writeup diff. there is an additional 'no desired p' in one of them but has 97% match
```diff
