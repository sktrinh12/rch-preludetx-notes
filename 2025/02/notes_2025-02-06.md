- this one looks the same still after fixes:
    * 157845 (bc part of ChemELN [81])
    * check on prelude-masks DM server (table browser):
```sql
with t as (
select experiment_id
from tm_experiments
where protocol_id in (501, 481)
)
select a.experiment_id, a.entry_date,
a.reaction_temp,
a.write_up
from
eln_writeup_full_012325 a
join t b
ON a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id
where a.write_up like '%?%'
```
- bug found in python script it was referencing `SYS_NAME[2]` and not `SYS_NAME[1]` which should be comparing prelude-masks with itself and not the sdpo backup server
    * however not sure why there aren't many '?' write_ups in the psql server
    * actually this may or may not have been necessary, ran the script yet again (stopped the previously running one and changed back to SYS_NAME[2])

```python
writeup1 = await fetch_write_up(exp_id, SYS_NAMES[1], analysis_date_1)
writeup2 = await fetch_write_up(exp_id, SYS_NAMES[2], analysis_date_2)
```


```sql
-- order by cro affinity first

ORDER BY
