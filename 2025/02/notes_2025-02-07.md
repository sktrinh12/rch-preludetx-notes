-To a solutin #REF! in #REF! was added #REF! and stirred at 25 °C  for 20 min. After that aqueous solution of #REF! was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to stir for 16 h at room temperature. TLC (petroleum ether:ethyl acetate=1:1， Rf=0.4 ) showed reactant was consumed completely and new point with greater polarity was formed. HPLC shows that the raw material reacts almost completely. The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with PE:EtOAc=2:1-1:1 to give #REF!. The target product was obtained, which HNMR was correct.
