## üìù Day 84, Tuesday - `notes_2025-02-11.md`

- RCH:
    * rds prelude psql db was not deleted after all and ran 241 hours charged about 40 USD
    * Dennis asked to get rid of it
    * removed rds instance and the affiliated SG that was open 0.0.0.0 on port 5432


- US206:
    * altered comparison table to allow system_name_2 to have any date
    * error when inserting a comparison of previous analysis date with today's date
    * `asyncpg.exceptions.ForeignKeyViolationError: insert or update on table "eln_writeup_comparison" violates foreign key constraint "eln_writeup_comparison_exp_id_system_name_2_analysis_date_fkey" DETAIL:  Key (exp_id, system_name_2, analysis_date)=(138774, prelude-prod-sdpo-8251, 2025-02-11) is not present in table "eln_writeup_api_extract".`
    * this previously worked before (US204) because the api ran for both system_names thus duplicating the rows (api fetch for both servers) but only actually needed one fetch
    * the duplication allowed for satisfying the foreign key constraint which is the system_name_2 and analysis_date (today's date) exists in `eln_writeup_api_extract` table before inserting
    * delete `exp_id_list` for better GC processes in the python api script

```sql
ALTER TABLE eln_writeup_comparison
DROP CONSTRAINT eln_writeup_comparison_exp_id_system_name_2_fkey;

```

- Genaro messaged thru teams asking about red status DS above, due to FULL JOIN on document_file
    * it is due to a FULL JOIN on the document_file base table; since someone uploaded teste documents without a affiliated experiment id, the FULL JOIN created null ids for those
    * the document uploads show up like: `oracle.sql.BLOB@1e8f0100	Test file for upload.pdf	testpdf`
    * that test upload should have been done on DEV and not PROD
