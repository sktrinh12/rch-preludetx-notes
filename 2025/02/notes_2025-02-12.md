## üìù Day 85, Wednesday - `notes_2025-02-12.md`

- US209 - add details to bioregister page:
    * on DEV created `bi_ab_name_list` and `bi_pyload_linker_list` DS based off of `ADC_REG_INFO` DS
    * created two string types for these dropdown menus
    * ordered the two columns to appear before conc; within DEV batch_MW and yield don't exist but conc does so placed before conc according to the screenshot

```sql
-- bi_ab_name_list
select distinct antibody_name from adc_reg_info where bioreg_id like 'PRT5%' order by antibody_name asc
;

-- bi_pyload_linker_list
select distinct payload_linker from adc_reg_info where bioreg_id like 'PRT5%' order by payload_linker desc
;
```
