- US211: user access stats
    * the query from yesterday was too slow, need to remove the unnecessary json payload structure
    * below is re-designed sql for `USER_ACCESS_LOGS` DS:

```sql

        a.LAST_RUN,
        'QUERY ' || COALESCE(a.NAME, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(c.DESCRIPTION, '') AS activity_descr,
        COALESCE(a.LAST_RESULT_COUNT, 0) AS count
    FROM
        DS3_APPDATA.USER_QUERIES a
    LEFT JOIN
        DS3_APPDATA.PROJECTS c
        ON a.PROJECT_ID = c.PROJECT_ID
),
a_audit AS (
    SELECT
        isid,
        time_stamp as last_run,
        action || ' ' || ip AS activity_descr
    FROM
        ds3_userdata.admin_audit

- 1on1:
    * talked about chemical inventory overhaul
    * need replacement
    * they have two vendors for demos; re-write connections to/from DMX and Titian 
    * DMX emailed back with inconvenient schedule for prelude checking
    * bioregister cannot expose the ab batch # and payload linker which are defined as parent samples and parent chemical samples; so US211 request cannot be achieved 

- US196:
    * back and forth with changing the sql in order to satisfy the team in regards to pdf export
    * needed to multiply factor 1000 for ABS IC50
    * change logic for dynamic decimal places rather than using `ROUND()`
