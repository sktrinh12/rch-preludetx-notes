## 📝 Day 88, Tuesday - `notes_2025-02-18.md`

- 1on1 with Genaro:
    * new DTX cloned prod live
    * edit script to accommodate for order of exp ids (affinity first)
    * run as soon as possible


```sql

SELECT experiment_id, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM DOTMATICS_APS_DEBUG_LOG
GROUP BY experiment_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC
;

--DS: dtx_exp_ids_sorted
with t as (
select a.experiment_id, a.protocol_id from ds3_userdata.tm_experiments a
join
ds3_userdata.DOTMATICS_APS_DEBUG_LOG b
on a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id
),
v as (
SELECT DISTINCT 
    experiment_id, 
    protocol_id,
    CASE WHEN protocol_id IN (501, 481) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END as priority_order
FROM t 
ORDER BY
    priority_order,
    experiment_id
)
select experiment_id from v
;

-- the original dtx summary DS for prelude-masks (1422)
SELECT a.experiment_id FROM tm_experiments a 
join eln_writeup b on a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id
WHERE protocol_id IN (81,142,501,303,321,481,581,261,322)
and b.write_up is not null
;


-- changed to:
with t as (
SELECT a.experiment_id, a.protocol_id FROM tm_experiments a 
join eln_writeup b on a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id
WHERE protocol_id IN (81,142,501,303,321,481,581,261,322)
and b.write_up is not null
),
v as (
SELECT DISTINCT 
    experiment_id, 
    protocol_id,
    CASE WHEN protocol_id IN (501, 481) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END as priority_order
FROM t 
ORDER BY
    priority_order,
    experiment_id
)
select experiment_id from v
;


--finally changed to thsi since there were so many missing exp ids:
-- this removes the missign 3000 exp ids in psql including the test exp id = 264361
SELECT a.experiment_id FROM tm_experiments a 
join eln_writeup b on a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id
WHERE protocol_id IN (501, 481)
and b.write_up is not null
and a.experiment_id <= 256068


-- delete for testing:

delete from eln_writeup_api_extract where  analysis_date = '2025-02-18';


delete from eln_writeup_comparison where  analysis_date = '2025-02-18';
```

- all of the sql cannot work because there is an intersect that happens within the DM API and cannot be controlled, so even when ordering by used in sql DS, it gets re-ordered by the greaterThan clause and other post-processing done by the API manager
    * tried to create another DS with protocol id to sort by within python, however that involved significantly more work
    * decided to just change the DS's to include Affinity protocols for now
    * git password cache was cleared somehow, de-bugging
    * had to restart psql and pgadmin4 again
    * api returning error for 264361; due to empty data or something (descr below)
    * it's registered as a real exp id in studies, so when we call all exp ids, it is included; but doesn't exist with real data on prelude-masks2; so it throws error in the api
    * turned out to be a test exp id made by DTX; the api cant distinguish it as a test
    * also strangely 3000+ exp ids were newly added to the prelude-masks server? they don't exist on psql?
    * now working on writing a separate psql query to grab current exp ids and find the intersection of the api call and this
 

- 1on1 Dennis:
    * holiday calendar
    * discuss DTX slowness and bureaucracy
    * allow some make-up hours from Monday's president day during the week
