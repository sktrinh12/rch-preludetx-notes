    * the scrape is an html so need to remove html tags and feed into calculations
    * use of context manager for database connection
    * updated dev ops board with links to commit history
    * alter table sql:

```sql
-- on prelude discoix server
ALTER TABLE eln_writeup_comparison
DROP CONSTRAINT eln_writeup_comparison_exp_id_system_name_1_fkey;

-- misc queries on server for testing:
SELECT * from ELN_WRITEUP_COMPARISON WHERE analysis_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 days';

This shows the amount of changes I did for this request. Total lines of code for the main script is 479. All git logs reflect the changes made to successfully get this script to work. I ran into a few errors along the way like:

```
ERROR - Error during scraping: Message: 'chromedriver.exe' executable may have wrong permissions.

ERROR - Database connection error: insert or update on table "eln_writeup_comparison" violates foreign key constraint "eln_writeup_comparison_exp_id_system_name_1_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (exp_id, system_name_1, analysis_date)=(192685, prelude-masks2, 2025-02-20) is not present in table "eln_writeup_api_extract".
```

- explanation
    * No write_up found for exp_id {exp_id} in system {system_name}.
    * The first error is because the way windows sets file permissions on the chromedriver.exe file. 
    * The second error is due to the foreign key constraint on comparison table. It is virtually impossible to foresee every future change and change request, I wouldn't have imagined we would run the script in such a manner, recall the scrapped data is in a separate table so these two projects [1) web scrape writeup 2) api call writeup] were initially isolated and did not relate to one another (thus the two conda environments), but now we are combining logic from both, so the only solution I could think of was to release the constraints from the database table
    * The third error involves race conditions between the psql query for the writeup thread and the comparison metric calculation psql thread; after investigation my solution pointed to using the threadpoolexecutor class to ensure the insert queries completed first prior to trying to execute the comparison calculations
    * Note** the scrape is an html output, so had to create a helper function to remove the html tags in order to feed into text comparison calculations

- unix command to check for errors in log file:
    * use WSL and change directory to `/mnt/c/Users/Disco-lx/`
    * error pointed to 192685 duplicate key, seemed to have already existed from prior run perhaps
    * appox calc of time to complete script: 3374 records / 200 records per hour = 16 hours
```bash
grep -i -C 2 'error' writeup_scrape_2025-02-20.log
```
