- preludetx discovered ~11 exp ids from the 3374 that have less than 96% match. After using the `fetch_writeup_api.py` script, copied and pasted the output for each 11 exp ids into devops board to demonstrate that the writeups themselves were completely different and it wasn't that there was an issue with the placeholders or masks. I.e. incomplete writeup sentences, or changed middway.
