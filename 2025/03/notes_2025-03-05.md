- work on US221
    * Testing Dotmatics system prior to PRD Changeover
    * preparation of testing @ 2AM for preludetx
    * need to on standby

- update devops board 215:
    * this project was only able to be replicated because DTX had created the ELN_WRITEUP_BACKUP on the oracle server prior. There is no way of achieving the same result without having back-end access. So only after having DTX create the backup DS, the project was created fairly easily. However, since we don't have backend access, the jupyter notebook was the solution to compare the before/after bugfix at the time
    * related: US188, US185, US187, U191
    * however, preludetx prefers to use DTX platform to make the manual checks, so the jupyter notebooks are obsolete

- worked on WIQL bash script to get User Story stats
    * create PAT token
    * query based on two users
