## üìù Day 98, Thursday - `notes_2025-03-06.md`

- check new prelude-masks3 domain for issues after DTX had executed bug fix
    * checked devops board and Raul mentioned issues with 2 exp ids in regards to decimal places
    * for the solvent it seems there is automatic rounding of the raw value; but it is probably done at a layer that is not exposed to users. In the base table for the solvent the volume is: 1.433938455361496 for exp id = 248615. In my opinion, it cannot be changed and we would have to accept it as is.
    * for exp id = 209967
    * the mmol and yield respectively for the products are: 1.95556198885431 & 72.6974717046212.
    * the weight and mmol respectively for the reactants are: 1109.5981 & 2.69, and for NaBH4, 300 & 7.929690081279323. so again it is being rounded.

```sql
select * from eln_reagents where id = 209967
;

select * from tm_text_masks
;

select write_up from eln_writeup where experiment_id = 209967
;
```

- write-up clob (HTML) for 209967

```html
<p>To a solution of&nbsp;{{1080:uid 1}} &nbsp;in&nbsp;{{3:uid 7024}} &nbsp;and&nbsp;{{3:uid 7081}} was added&nbsp;{{1080:uid 2}} &nbsp;The mixture was stirred at&nbsp;room temperature for 30 min before full conversion was observed on LC-MS. The mixture was diluted with water and DCM (20 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (3 x 10 mL).&nbsp;The combined organic phase was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude product, which was&nbsp;purified by flash column chromatography (0-50% EtOAc/Heptane) to afford the title compound {{2:uid 1}} , a beige solid.</p>

- meeting with Genaro and Askold to verbally confirm the new instance will be used for the prod
- devops board wisql bash script improvement to select diff users; read pat from two locations (fallback)

##### Issue with new test exp id (wilmington) study after bug fix:

- was not given exp id, simply, "most recent wilmington"
- figured out exp by this sql, which sorted by most recent:
```sql
SELECT a.experiment_id FROM tm_experiments a 
join eln_writeup b on a.experiment_id = b.experiment_id
WHERE protocol_id IN (501, 481)
and b.write_up is not null
order by created_date desc
;

select write_up from eln_writeup where experiment_id = 267203
```

- seems as though, whoever created it didn't use the mask templates
    * Jeff confirmed this in email; mask reagents are blue and underlined (like a link) plain text is black
    * users were cloning exp ids and not creating from scratch
    * check count of bug fix (from log table)
