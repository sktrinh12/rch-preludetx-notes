## üìù Day 99, Friday - `notes_2025-03-07.md`

- DTX bug fix application is finished
    * however a 'bug' was discovered
    * users cloning previous cloned experiments without updating the '?' 
    * email sent to the chemists team to notification
    * compile (or refresh the DS) every friday evening on schedule rather than every day which would overload the system; didn't seem possible. only able to change the priority and time of all DS refreshes, not individually
    * added GENERIC assay project to PROD
