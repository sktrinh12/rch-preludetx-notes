##### 1on1 Genaro:
- test sql validation for user access validate:
- also mentioned clean up DS or unnecessarily long sql; however mentioned that we can use cookie cutter sql blocks to make the changes, otherwise it would take too long

```sql
-- select random isid's
SELECT isid 
FROM tm_groups_users
ORDER BY DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE
FETCH FIRST 8 ROWS ONLY
;

-- create a custom isid table
select 'k.vaddi' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'awang' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'smaity' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'mhawkins' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'eqiao' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'j.zhuo' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'cchen' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'jrose' from dual
UNION ALL
select 'preludeadmin' from dual
;

select isid from
GATEWAY.PERSONNEL_ROLES
where valuename = 'DTX_ELN_MASKS'
;

SELECT distinct valuename FROM GATEWAY.PERSONNEL_ROLES
order by valuename
;

-- validation sql
select 1 from dual where exists (select isid from user_access_allowed where isid = '-USER-')
;
```

- test of the TEST_PROJ_USAGE project:
    * create a new form and copy as a project form
    * the form should have the table or data that is to be viewed (with validation/approval)
    * `/browser/query/query.jsp?currentProjectID=103000&currentFormID=622`
    * create label as button: add the URL, and then the validation sql
    * change the css when invalid, so user knows it cannot be viewed
    * workflow: user clicks 'Run query' and if the label button sql validation returns 1 then the user is allowed to view the data and able to click button to get re-directed to the form; if not the button shows a grey colour and the user cannot click it
