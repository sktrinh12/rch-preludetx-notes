## üìù Day 105, Monday - `notes_2025-03-17.md`

- US226 - KAT6A PK table needs to be reviewed
    * there are 4 unnamed columns:
    * for the %HBF row:
    * 1) - PK_RAT_IV_VW
    * 2) - PK_MOUSE_IV_VW
    * 3) - PK_DOG_IV_VW
    * 4) - PK_MONKEY_IV_VW 
    * theory is that user doesn't know which one to read and reads the value that exists; perhaps need a column name added
    * in fact it was set to DOG prior to investigating, whilst investigating Genaro was fixing the issue and thus showed MONKEY at the time of writing this
    * **resolved**
    
- US228 - create new user
    * there was a typo; IT didn't spell correctly possibly
    * during investigation, no way to change ISID or ID of new user name
    * the following tables were explored:

```sql
select *  from DS3_APPDATA.USER_PREFERENCES
where isid like 'm%'
;


select * from DS3_APPDATA.USER_PREFERENCES
where isid like 'm%'
;

-- only this one shows just the isid's however the new user's name didn't show in the list
select * from DS3_USERDATA.USER_NAMES_SUMM
where ISID like 'm%'
;
```

- sent email to support help desk:
    * Case Number: 00069159
    * Subject: Fix typo in new user name - preludetx

- US227 - JAK2 Summary page add new cell line from proliferation table
    * Response on DEVOPS: `This will require appending block of code for SUMM_JAK2 DS. Just to double check, according to git logs, the UT-7 cell line with AlpaLISA was added 13 Jan 2025. The only difference this time is the assay type is CTG?`
    * need to 4PL Luminescene cellular IC50; duplicate of CTG dropdown list in assay type
    * turns out I was right, there is a duplciate dictionary key/value item that differs in obviously the prop_id and the PROP_GROUP which = 'CLD' for one and nothing for the other

```sql
-- used to diagnose the duplicate CellTiterGlow in dropdown menu of Luminescene cellular IC50 protocol
select *
from ds3_userdata.TM_PROTOCOL_PROP_LOOKUP where PROP_TYPE='ASSAY_TYPE'
and prop_value like 'Cell%'
ORDER BY PROP_VALUE
```
