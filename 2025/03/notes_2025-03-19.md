    * need to confirm that when deleting one does it affect other expt ids that used the 'deleted' one?
    * or is it grabbing just the value, which in that case it wouldn't matter which one we delete
    * the sql below is evidence that only the PROP_VALUE is extracted so it should't matter what DICT row is removed from the duplicates

```sql

- US225:
    * make changes to table and order as well as remove some columns
    * change DS to only include %response and raw data, show %response first and possibly set as default? default value config

- US228: New user typo
    * DTX replied with, not possible
    * disabled user with typo and re-created
