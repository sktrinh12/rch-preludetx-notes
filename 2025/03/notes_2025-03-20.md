## 📝 Day 108, Thursday - `notes_2025-03-20.md`

- tasks:
    * re-order columns (23) as per the acceptance criteria
    * kept `experiment_id` and `descr` just in case at the end
    * removed other misc columns from UI but not from DS
    * added `formatted_id` column
    * on DEV created prototype search box
    * in order for the sql validation to work needed to figure out the project id and form id of the landing page using sql
    * after testing of search box on DEV -> migrated to PROD

```sql
-- sql validation to hide the label when the multifield box executes (default behavior is to disappear)
-- PROD
SELECT 1 FROM DUAL WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT MAX(QUERY_ID) AS ID FROM DS3_APPDATA.USER_QUERIES WHERE PROJECT_ID= 101000 AND FORM_ID=526)
;

-- DEV 
SELECT 1 FROM DUAL WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT MAX(QUERY_ID) AS ID FROM DS3_APPDATA.USER_QUERIES WHERE PROJECT_ID= 106000 AND FORM_ID=53)
;
-- find the project id for generic assay data export
select * from ds3_APPDATA.projects
where description like 'GENER%'
;

-- find the form_id for the project_id (generic assay data export)
select * from DS3_APPDATA.FORM_OBJECTS
WHERE PARENT_PROJECT_ID =  101000
;
```

##### US229
- additional check whether deleting one of the duplicates is ok
    * sql below is double confirmation the PROP_ID and PROP_GROUP are not captured in the studies data:
    * the expt id is the only current exp id that is of CTG and UT-7 cell line

```sql
select * from tm_prot_exp_fields_values
where property_name = 'Assay Type'
and experiment_id = 262122
;

-- third check
-- 215667 is a newly created EXP ID on DEV which was created for testing
-- the CTG duplicate was delete prior and only one was left for the dropdown menu (with PROP_GROUP = 'CLD')
