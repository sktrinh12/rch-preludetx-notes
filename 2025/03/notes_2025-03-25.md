## üìù Day 111, Tuesday - `notes_2025-03-25.md`

- US239 - Extract all experimental data for two PRT#'s since the beginning:
    * Need all data from the beginning similar to what GENERIC_ASSAY_DATA provides but without the date filter
    * idea is to create second DS that has no date filter and only lock in on the compound ids in order to make the table more manageable
    * another option is to replace the generic assay export without the date filter, tested using a temporary DS sql execution and the cost for it was 51k vs 4k but it compiled
    
- US240 - Create custom DS refresh schedule for GENERIC_ASSAY_DATA
    * investigated documentation for specific DS refresh
    * add days and times like cronjob - every friday at 13:00 EST
    * ran `SELECT SYSDATE FROM DUAL` to ensure the system time was sync'd with EST
    * created SQL Runner that adds an event in `EVENT_TRIGGER` table
    * it seems that SQL Runner is executed after DS update; so test on DEV whether the SQL Runner will be executed without triggering (configuring a schedule) on SQL Runner itself
```sql
INSERT INTO DS3_APPDATA.EVENT_TRIGGER(EVENT,ID) VALUES ('DSUPDATER','GENERIC_ASSAY_DATA_EXPORT')
-DAYS:25-
-TIMES:13:00,13:30,13:45,13:55,14:00,14:15,14:30,14:45,14:55,15:00,15:15,15:30-
;

-- view the EVENT_TRIGGER table
select * from DS3_APPDATA.EVENT_TRIGGER
order by CREATED DESC
;

-- check DS disabled status
SELECT 
  *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        "SQH_ID", 
        "SQH_DS", 
        "SQH_USER", 
        "SQH_TS", 
        "SQH_STATUS", 
        "SQH_TEXT",
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY "SQH_DS" 
            ORDER BY "SQH_TS" DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM DS3_APPDATA.BRO_DS_SQL_HISTORY
) ranked
WHERE rn = 1
AND SQH_STATUS  = 1
ORDER BY "SQH_DS"
;
```

- CRONJOB for DEV Sql Runner:
    * for reference
    * removed the cron schedule in SQL Runner to prove that the DS refresh triggers this
```
00:00, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 05:00, 06:00, 07:00, 08:00, 09:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00, 17:00, 18:00, 19:00, 20:00, 21:00, 22:00, 23:00
```

- disabled DS to save latency:
