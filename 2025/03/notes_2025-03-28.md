## üìù Day 114, Friday - `notes_2025-03-28.md`

- US223: KAT6 assays not showing in Assay data 
    * the issue is that the exp ids like 267251 include PRT#'s that have cofactor_conc = 3 uM, KAT6A target, and cofactor = Acetyl-Coa but the SUMM_KAT6A sql code only specifies for 0.5 uM with actual mu symbol
    * so the user doesn't know whether they want 0.5 uM + 3 uM pooled in the aggregation calcs, or if they want two separate KAT6A tables
    * the other targets like KAT7, KAT8 etc all have 3 uM cofactor conc, so there is no split in the data
    * update from meeting is that they are dropping the 0.5 uM cofactor conc and changing the exp parameter to 3 uM; therefore aggregate on this value and leave the 0.5 as is but not included in the SUMM_KAT6A

- RCH GIT & Obsidian training
    * use `:Git log -1 --format='%H' -- %` to grab commit hash
    * then copy paste into `:Git show` to get latest commit changes on current buffer
    * also can run in terminal: `git show $(git log -1 --format=%H -- {FILE_NAME})`

- 1on1 Genaro:
    * push to PROD: US227/US223
    * get approval for git commit counter; also can develop custom widget if need be

- US227:
    * check the sql below once DS is updated with new code
    * updated JAK2 forms by adding the UT7 table in between SET2 and TF1
    * ran into: `ERROR: an error occurred or you may not have access to perform this action, please contact an administrator`
    * `28Mar 17:11:34.708              ERROR        RestfulBroker - An error occurred processing the request com.dotmatics.dataig.restful.RestfulException: only admins may query this collection`
    * however was able to still save the changes, strange error cannot avoid, next time simply create new table and not clone table? 

```sql
select 
    ic50_nm_ctg_ut7,
    ctg_ut7_abs_ic50,
    n_ic50_ctg_ut7,
    resp_hc_ctg_ut7,
    sd_ic50_ctg_ut7,
    cs_ic50_ctg_ut7
from SUMM_JAK2
where ic50_nm_ctg_ut7 IS NOT NULL
```
