## üìù Day 115, Monday - `notes_2025-03-31.md`

- US245:
    * updated table order for CTG UT7 assay data

- 1on1:
    * need to start working on Tetrascience SSP 
    * US240 - the response from DTX does not address the issue at hand still. On PROD Run Next is configured the same way but does not refresh DS every 5 mins. The Trigger tab also is set to 60 seconds interval. On Dev the only thing that was different was the DS refresh schedule: 13:00 to 17:30; however now changed to only 01:00, 10:00, 13:00
    * on PROD when checked today (Mon 31 March @11:25) the TRIGGER EVENT table shows:
    * on PROD the last time a trigger was executed was on 28 March Friday whereas on DEV; it happened just ~4 minutes ago (since it is triggering after every DS refresh which is mysteriously happening every ~5 mins)
    * This leads me to think there is an actual Oracle level trigger on the server itself that is executing outside of the DTX environment and thus does not show in the DEV configuration.

##### tetrascience SSP Hello World Example:
    * issue was `strinh` user was Member as well as Administrator, thus the auth.json was failing: `Response from platform: User with 'support' policies is not allowed to perform this action`
    * removed Member status and only kept to `Administrator`; re-ran the ts-cli publish command and it built
    * need to set namespace in protocol.yml file to be the same as when running the `ts-cli` command for the `--namespace` flag
    * refreshed tetrascience portal to view the newly uploaded protocol in the protocol dropdown list (within the `private-preludetx` section
    * after some time, received email notification from tetrascience:
    * basically, it seems when user uploads data to egnyte shared drive, it triggers this pipeline
    * IDS - The Intermediate Data Schema (IDS) used
    * after two tests, disabled the protocol
    * git logged and committed to azure devops repo
