- US246 - DMX 6.2 User login authenticating from 4 IPs
    * preludetx noticed 4 different ip logins using preludeadmin
    * ran `ip-check.sh` bash script to investigate the ip addresses
    * responded on DEVOPS board:
>i used iplook up and got this as json, i believe it has something to do with how AWS does internal ip trafficking. I believe those logins are me, since my internet is originating from amazon. The logs might be showing internal AWS IPs from their side because DTX is hosted on AWS and my traffic is also coming from AWS; so both have AWS data center "signatures" so to speak; thus there is some randomization of ip addresses. when i do a 'whatsmyipaddress' on my laptop, it doesn't correlate with any of those ip addresses. perhaps it was from before and gets randomized each time? I'm curious, was this the old prelude-upgrade6 instance? and those logs show from what date?

>looking at logs and converting to table below (DEV). This shows the audit trail, so it doesn't seem to correlate with the logs seen in DTX, reason to believe that it is being connected through some type of api or script and not a human; maybe the testadmin is logging in and then another process within the testadmin login, is logging in as preludeadmin? the logs below correlate with java.sql.SQLException: Cannot create PoolableConnectionFactory (IO Error: The Network Adapter could not establish the connection) error. Might be originating from same script/pipeline?

- the result from table browser was copied and pasted into vim, converted into csv and passed (piped) to `convert-table.sh`

- US249 - familiarize with tetrascience platform and create test ssp
    * source_type = 'attune'
    * tag with instrument id/name
    * connect file share to tdp
    * temporarily use egnyte cloud drive for testing, file path: `/Private/lab-connect/Imaging/Attune_images_UAT/**/*.*`
    * created new service user & `auth.json` file on UAT testing environment
    * 

- US250 KAT6B on DEV
    * edit DS: SUMM_KAT6A in PROD git repo since now DEV is snapshot of PROD with new version 6.2
    * Seems like we have encountered some inconsistent naming of metadata again:
        * The 'L' is capitalized in one and not the other
        * The 'T' is capitalized in one and not the other
        * **HeLa-HiBiT-KAT6B**
        * **Hela-HiBit-KAT6A**
    * Will use `LIKE` in query to adapt to the data
    * wrote sql to get PRT#'s
