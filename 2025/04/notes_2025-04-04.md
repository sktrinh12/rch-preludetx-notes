## üìù Day 119, Friday - `notes_2025-04-04.md`

- US248 - read up on drive sharing on TS
    * Tetra Hub is the on-premises software component of the Tetra Data Platform (TDP). It facilitates secure data transfer between the TDP and Connectors and Agents, which can each pull or receive data from individual data sources
    * use of Tetra Hub v2 (newer) Tetra Data Hub will be deprecated
    * agents installed on VM (on-prem or cloud)
    * uses AWS SSM & AWS ECS & CloudWatch in the background
    * the network server or VM that you install a Hub on must allow TetraScience to remotely reboot the local or virtual machine
    * this requirement may exclude the WSL system; may need a dedicated LINUX system (i.e. EC2, on-prem linux)
    * Supported OS:
        * Ubuntu 18.04 and higher versions
        * RedHat 7.5 and higher versions
        * CentOS 7 and higher versions
    * the `installer.sh` installs following tools: 
        * Docker
        * jq
        * curl
        * Amazon ECS container agent
        * Amazon CloudWatch agent
        * AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent)
    * May or may not need to configure Hub to use a proxy (corporate)
        * most likely not needed since the preludetX01 server has internet access
    * Once a `Hub` is created on TS platform, go to the `Hub Details` page, choose `Install Hub`. An Install a Hub popup appears.
    * Get the preconfigured Tetra Hub installation script by choosing one of the following options:
`Download Installation Script` -or- `Copy Installation Script`. Transfer the installation script to your dedicated Tetra Hub environment (VM/on-prem).
    * In your dedicated Tetra Hub environment, open a new terminal session. Then, navigate to the root account by running the following command: `sudo su`
    * Open an installer file in a text editor. For example, to open the nano text editor, you can run the following command: `vim installer.sh`
    * In the text editor, enter the installation script. Then, save the changes and exit the text editor.
    * Make the file runnable by running the following command: `chmod +x installer.sh`
    * Run the installation script by running the following command: `./installer.sh`
```bash

- US242 - clean up DS:
    * find table_name in entire db (all schemas) based on `LIKE`
    * preludetx mentioned a contractor that created several temp tables but not sure if cleaned up

```sql
-- TSMITH or TRS contactor name; named temp tables possibly this way, however didn't find any
SELECT owner, table_name
FROM all_tables
WHERE table_name LIKE 'TSMITH%'
```

- US250 - Add KAT6B HiBit data to summary page
    * in hands of end user. will wait until CAB approval to push to PROD
    * preludetx to write roll-out/back plan on autotask for CAB approval
    * updated DS for SUMM_KAT6A_MSR/OMSR for red highlighting for certain values (conditional formatting) also formatting to `SF3`

- US249:
    * ran `ts-cli publish` commands to update the ssp
    * perhaps the `input` is defined in the `protocol.yml` and passes as args to the `main.py`
```sh
