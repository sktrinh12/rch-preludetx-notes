## üìù Day 121, Tuesday - `notes_2025-04-08.md`

- US240 - DS refresh
    * create test DS and update the SQL Runner trigger sql
    * the test below creates a tmp DS that only has one column `COUNTER` and the integers 1-8
    * the trigger will increment the counter to 9 if triggered by `Sql Runner`
    * the trigger can be changed to delete the row where `COUNTER = 9` to reset the DS
    * the following day the trigger should show a `Last Started` timestamp of 01:15 after the DS refresh, and have the row `COUNTER = 9` in the DS
    * the logs should also show that `dsql-3ZC2ASHF` trigger ID was triggered
    * after the 6.2 upgrade on DEV, the event_trigger table is empty: `select * from DS3_APPDATA.EVENT_TRIGGER`

```sql
-- TMP_TRIGGER_COUNTER
select 0 AS COUNTER from dual
union all
select 1 from dual
union all
select 2 from dual
union all
select 3 from dual
union all
select 4 from dual
union all
select 5 from dual
union all
select 6 from dual
union all
select 7 from dual
union all
select 8 from dual
;

-- trigger
INSERT INTO TMP_TRIGGER_COUNTER (COUNTER)
VALUES (
(SELECT NVL(MAX(COUNTER), 0) + 1 FROM TMP_TRIGGER_COUNTER)
)
-DAYS:12345-
;

-- delete stmt
DELETE FROM TMP_TRIGGER_COUNTER
WHERE COUNTER = 9
;
```

- US249 - tetrascience SSP
    * updated `main.py` to read file and print out `input_file`
    * git logged and pushed
    * `ts-cli publish` protocol and task-script
    * use of preludeX01 server on ivanti to trigger pipeline by creating placeholder bitmap file
    * still testing the data format of `input`; ran into many errors
