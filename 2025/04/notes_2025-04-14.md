## üìù Day 125, Monday - `notes_2025-04-14.md`

- US256 - Modify SD values from uM to nM for JAK2 assays
    * updated `JAK2_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` DS to include `IC50_NM`
    * changed `SD` column to be: `STDDEV(ic50_nm) AS sd` for t11 and t14 subqueries for the main `SUMM_JAK2` DS

- BG255 - UT7 N-count is counting internal replicates, SET2 is correct
    * problem with swapped minr value in UNION ALL of subquery and missing prefix for the compound status in DS config
    * removed unnecessary  `SELECT * ...` within subqueries
    * add `SELECT` of `IC50_NM` in subqueries
    * changed `t14.d` to `t4.d` for cell line = 'UT-7' and assay_type = `CellTiter-Glow`
    * changed JOIN statement at end to:

```diff
-                     AND t13.assay_type = t14.assay_type
-                     AND t13.cell_line = t14.cell_line
-                     AND t13.target = t14.target
-                     AND t13.time_hr = t14.time_hr
+                     AND t11.assay_type = t14.assay_type
+                     AND t11.cell_line = t14.cell_line
+                     AND t11.target = t14.target OR (t11.target IS NULL AND t14.target IS NULL)
+                     AND t11.time_hr = t14.time_hr
```

#### alternative method
tried to break up subqueries into separate DS's on DEV. however, the compilation failed to complete as well. 
- separated `t5, t3, t13` into separate DS: `t5_subq_summ_jak2, t3_subq_summ_jak2, t13_subq_summ_jak2`
- separated the main core subquery into seperate DS: `subq_summ_jak2
    * `t1_t2`
    * `t3_t4`
    * `t5_t6`
    * `t11_14`
    * `t13_14`
- easy for mgmt and reading
- cannot update DS for SUMM_JAK2, major error
    * reverted back to last commited/pushed SQL from git
