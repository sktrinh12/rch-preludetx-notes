## 📝 Day 128, Thursday - `notes_2025-04-17.md`

- US261 - Create new modular `SUMM_JAK2` and test for equivalency
    * updated devops board with all sql and python code for this test
    * created all DS on DEV environment; now both environments have the `TMP_SUMM_JAK2` DS
    * tediously and carefully copy paste from table browser (DEV) results into `.csv` file; only can copy ~30-40 rows at a time and only max of 100 rows for each query
    * `TMP_OUTPUT_JAK2_PRTN` was compiled on PROD, but didn't exist even after successful compilation on DEV *unknown reason*
    * started working on jlab notebook to analyze `.csv` file

- BG260 - JAK2 studies not populating
    * perhaps DS not refreshed yesterday at the time they expected it since DSUPDATER was not running; only runs at 01:00 EST and if `Calculations` mode triggers Datasources?  
    * may need to look into a trigger that will happen on Weds around 13-14:00 EST for the JAK2 team
    * 269404, 269405 and 269406
    * wrote sql to grab PRT#s and data for these exp ids

- US240 - DS refresh
- The `-DAYS-` flag works, but the `-TIMES-` flag won't work in this case because according to docs:

>When forcing a SQL runner via force/trigger (see [Schedule for SQL runner](https://documentation.dotmatics.com/br/6.2/admin-guide/settings/schedules/sql-runner-scheduling#id-.SQLRunnerv2020.1-Sch_sql_run) below) and DAYS and TIMES parameters are set, the SQL will only run if the DAYS and TIMES parameters match. If they do not match, the SQL will be skipped and a message will be displayed in the logs.

- Since the time that `GENERIC_ASSAY_DATA` DS is requested to be updated is on a Friday at 13:00, this doesn't not coincide with the 01:00 Datasource refresh schedule; and won't happen, the `-DAYS-` flag will work and will trigger immediately after the Datasource refresh
- Only way to trigger a specific project DS would be to build something external; also cannot use API since there is not exposed endpoints for `POST` or updating the schedules module, only to `GET` retrieve data:

>/schedules [admin]  
The schedules collection returns information about the schedules that run inside Browser and their  
configuration.
