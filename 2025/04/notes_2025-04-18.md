## üìù Day 129, Friday - `notes_2025-04-18.md`

##### Test results on setting trigger on Weds & Fri (US 240 - DS refresh)
- Weds (2025-16-Apr):
    * `Last Started` shows, 2025-04-16 04:29	
    * `tmp_trigger_counter` shows 10 rows as expected
    * this seems to be working properly; since the `DAYS` are set to only Weds and Fri (today is Weds)
    * So as long as DS has `Run Next` set to SQL Runner, this should work
    * However, on PROD `Run Next` for `Datasources` was changed(?) or set to `None` whereas DEV shows `SQL Runner`
- Friday (2025-18-Apr):
    * `Last Started` shows, 2025-04-18 01:27
    * `tmp_trigger_counter` shows 10 rows as expected
    * check `select * from ds3_appdata.event_trigger` and shows nothing

##### US261 - Create new TMP_SUMM_JAK2
- Issue on DEV not creating the DS `TMP_OUTPUT_JAK2_PRTN` even though it gave the "blue" confirmation text at the top. Tried several times, no errors and shows signs the DS was created, however when querying in `TABLE BROWSER` it shows: `ORA-00942: table or view does not exist`

- Instead, workaround was to create `.csv` file manually:

##### Steps for creating `.csv` file from DEV (output of `TMP_OUTPUT_JAK2_PRTN`): 
    * continue working on jlab notebook to analyze `.csv` file that was sourced manually from `TABLE BRWOSER` by tediously copying and pasting 30-40 rows at a time from a max limit of 100 rows per sql query
    * there were `3731` rows, thus ran SQL 37 times and copied chunks of 30-40 at a time (up to 100) and repeated
