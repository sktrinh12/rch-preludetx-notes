## 📝 Day 130, Monday - `notes_2025-04-21.md`

##### US261 - Create new TMP_SUMM_JAK2
- continue working on jlab notebook
    * on PROD added `TMP_OUTPUT_JAK2_PRTN` to Registry 2.0 project since it includes all/most of PRT#s
    * ran sql: `select * from registry_summary_vw where formatted_id IN ( select distinct formatted_id from tmp_output_jak2_prtn)` to check all 118 PRT#s exists; then open view wizard and exported to csv the data
    * ran bash command to remove empty rows: `awk -F',' 'NR==1 || ($2 != "" || $3 != "" || $4 != "" || $5 != "")' input.csv > tmp_output_jak2_prtn_prod.csv`
    * had to fix a few rows in the DEV `.csv` file due to missing values (copy/pasted errors)
    * DEV clearly shows unequal SD (stddev) values since the fix for #US256 changed on PROD but not for DEV (`SUMM_JAK2`); but the `TMP_SUMM_JAK2` has these SD changes implemented
    * jlab results exported `.html` files for DEV and PROD to show the heatmap of each PRT# and column name measurement value
```sql
-- check if values are the same for prt# and column name
select span_set2
from tmp_summ_jak2
where formatted_id = 'PRT1012332'
union all
select span_set2
from summ_jak2
where formatted_id = 'PRT1012332'
```

##### 1on1 PreludeTx:
- notes
    * US242 - clean up DS; perhaps another good check would be to do a search of all current/active sql DS for references to any of these DS/tables
    * add user activity in csv export
    * for #US240 - need to write follow-up email to Suquin on DS refresh
    * #BG255 requires US261 to complete prior to UAT completion so pending
    * brief overview of new project for NGS data analysis pipeline on AWS - hired consultant (external to run analysis and possibly create infrastructure)
    * seems they need to set up AWS resources (ec2 with s3 access) - suggested use of terraform to set up; however seems like the bioinformatic consultant might try to offer their services to achieve this; which might be better depending on how complicated and esoteric the config/setup is


##### What is DRAGEN?
DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics) is a high-performance bioinformatics software suite developed by Illumina for analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. It’s designed to be ultra-fast, highly accurate, and scalable, making it accessible for labs of any size.

##### How DRAGEN is Used
* It performs secondary analysis of NGS data — meaning it processes raw sequencing reads (FASTQ files) into meaningful variant calls (e.g., SNPs, indels, CNVs, SVs).
* Can be run on-premises (on a dedicated DRAGEN server) or in the cloud via Illumina platforms like BaseSpace or Connected Analytics.
* Often integrated into sequencing systems like NovaSeq X, NextSeq, and MiSeq i100.

##### Key Benefits
* Speed: Processes a 40× whole human genome in ~34 minutes vs ~8 hours using traditional tools.
* Accuracy: Uses advanced features like pangenome references and machine learning for variant calling.
* Compression: Reduces FASTQ file size up to 5× with DRAGEN ORA (Original Read Archive).
* Hardware Acceleration: Uses FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) to accelerate analysis, making it faster without requiring a huge computing setup.

##### Applications
* Germline and somatic variant calling
* Structural variation and copy number analysis
* Oncology workflows
* Pharmacogenomics (e.g., star allele calling)
* Multi-genome mapping with pangenome references
