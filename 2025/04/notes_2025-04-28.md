##### BG267 
- after more investigation it seems the issue lies in the DS, `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`
    * sql code for PDF export and DS are completely different, so perhaps that is why it explains in the PDF export it shows '>' whereas in the browser page, it doesn't have it
    * `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` has separate logic for `COMPOUND_STATUS` which is based off of `r2` value from fit model; however it should simply just capture this column value from `IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY` since it already has the proper logic for `COMPOUND_STATUS`: `CASE WHEN t5.label = 'Inactive'    THEN '>' WHEN t5.label = 'Very Potent' THEN '<' END              AS compound_status, ...`
    * on the other hand in the pdf export config, the logic is simply taking the first string of the `reported_result` value which, if it has a `>` or `<` then it will retain it
    * this is why the browser page of KAT6A and the pdf export are not showing consistent results because the logic is not the same
    * in regards to the "missing" response @HC, it is because the `POW()` and `AVG()` and `LOG()` cannot be done on negative values, the `MAX(ic90)` for the `t9.name` (% Response @HC) turns out to be negative; this needs added logic to be `0`? or the user needs to understand that when it is `NULL` it was a negative value
    * made changes to DEV instance (4PL - Luminescence Cellular IC50) & the DS `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`
    * below is the `PDF_CONFIG_EXPORT` sql that has been re-factored
