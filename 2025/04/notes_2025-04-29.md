#### US268 - change amount for batch sample PRT1012995
- closed ticket since it seemed to have been already fixed (perhaps by the user or another power-user of DMX)
    * conducted SQL query to ensure the value was what was requested in the ticket

- Go to Register -> View Samples -> Magnifying glass -> Search for the ID = 308010 (copied from sql output below)
    * need to `Edit Columns` in order to show the `amount` column and edit, then save changes

```sql
select * from c$pinpoint.reg_samples
where formatted_sample_id = 'PRT1012995-001-001'
```
