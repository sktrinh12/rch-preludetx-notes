## üìù Day 138, Thursday - `notes_2025-05-01.md`

#### US271 - Disable user account
- Received `Autotask` email, however when checked in DTX PROD env, the user was already disabled
    * attached screenshot of `User Admin` and pasted the `Autotask` ID


#### US 270 - Generate or collect test images for deduplication
- researched on image deduplication topic
    * script will use 1 of 2 metrics (1) hamming (2) mse


#### US265 - research TS:
- *watched video*: `File-Log Agent (FLA): Configuration and Feature Highlights`
[https://tetrascience.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/31980526039949-File-Log-Agent-FLA-Configuration-and-Feature-Highlights](https://tetrascience.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/31980526039949-File-Log-Agent-FLA-Configuration-and-Feature-Highlights)
    * Since there is one `F:\` shared drive and the client wants to add individual separate sub-folders that signify instrument and data source type; and given there is only one FLA installed on the windows 11 server (preludeX01); best suggestion given the information, is to define the source type as *f-drive* -related and define agent level and path level labels
    * In this manner, down the road if a new agent installed on separate VM that shares the same `F:\` drive will be distinguishable via the agent level labels and will take care of separate path level labels

#### US264 - update current ts pipelines
- current egnyte file paths on PROD:
    * `/Private/lab-connect/Screening/Tecan_Gen2/**/*.*`  - connector for Tecan Pipeline 1-JULY-2024
    * `/Private/lab-connect/Screening/PheraStar_Gen2/**/*.*`
    * `/Private/lab-connect/Screening/PlateReader_Gen2/**/*.*` - connector for Plate Reader Pipeline 1-JULY-2024
    * created new file path on agent, added labels based on recommended labels, and tested a basic `.csv` file upload to the `F:\Screening\Pherastar_gen2` directory 
        * all labels showed up properly and the `Decorate RAW PheraStar data` pipeline triggered the 3x label additions
