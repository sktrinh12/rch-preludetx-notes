## üìù Day 141, Tuesday - `notes_2025-05-06.md`

- For autotask ticket: `T20250506.0068`
    * user `dhinton@preludetx.com` reported having issues accessing dotmatics
    * logged into autotask and read the ticket; seems it is an IT microsoft 365 issue, not show how the user is trying to log in thru the microsoft portal?
    * added user to `biology` group just in case (testing)

- US266 - fill out FLA config `.xlsx` file:
    * inspected raw output files from pherastar, tecan, and envision instruments to collect metadata and filled out more information

- US265 - research and investigate
    * Within `Data Sources` on TS platform, scroll down the `Dotmatics` connector
    * this is how the `dotmatics-register-compound` IDS is formed
    * sql to understand what the pipeline is doing, the project_id and ds_id were obtained from the DMX connector details:

```sql
-- get ds name by project id and ds id
select *  from DS3_APPDATA.data_sources 
where project_id = 71000
and ds_id = 926
;

-- the ds that is being queried using API from TS
select * from REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW_NEW
where reg_id = 1012396
-- grabs the `amount` column to update the inventory
```

- `Inject Dotmatics into Mosaic` pipeline is triggered by `Dotmatics RAW to IDS Pipeline_prd`
    * `Dotmatics RAW to IDS Pipeline_prd` is probably automatically triggered by a watcher/poller on the `REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW_NEW` DS which is called thru the DTX api using the project id and ds id; there is a `SECONDS_ELAPSED` column which orders the ds `ASC` so the very first row is the most recent registered batch
    * the Dotmatics connector probably retrieves this most recent batch (reg_id) and saves it into the data lake which is then converted to IDS thru the pipeline as file similar to, `1013047.json`; the path is `/register/compound/1013047.json` and source type is `dotmatics-register-compound` and source name is `Dotmatics Data Connector`
    * ultimately, the pipeline, `Dotmatics IDS to CSV Pipeline_prd` is run automatically thru the trigger, which converts the json into a csv mapping table

- US272 - change formatted batch id typo
    * change PRT number fixed for a batch of compound. PRT1012969-001 should actually be PRT1012883-002. They are the same compound.
    * sql to investigate:
```sql
select * from c$pinpoint.reg_batches
where formatted_batch_id = 'PRT1012969-001'
-- the results show batch_id = 241327
-- and user = cgong
```
