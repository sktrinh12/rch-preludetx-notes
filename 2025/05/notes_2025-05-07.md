## 📝 Day 142, Wednesday - `notes_2025-05-07.md`

- US273 - T47D assay data for KAT6A
    * uploaded information on DEVOPS board from autotask email
    * need clarification on what to do
    * exp_id: 268389 for understanding the data for T47D. It will require new aggregation and calculations for exposing the data
    * Genaro will present to CAB meeting tomorrow and officially write out requirements clearly in ticket
    * users expressed urgency for this request

- US265 - Research and investigate how to implement FLA for current active pipelines
    * updated DEVOPS board with information from `dotmatics-register-compound` IDS

- US264 - update current ts pipelines
    * preludetx wants UAT finished by today for tecan and envision pipelines
    * preludetx will present in CAB meeting for approval and migration to PROD
    * re-configured FLA for these two separate filepaths

- US274 - UAT testing for Envision FLA
    * updated tecan and revvity envision pipelines to use the shared `F:\` drive
    * within the pipeline trigger used the `instrument_model` "label" for selectively triggering a specific file
    * also used the `filepath` contains operator to ensure specificity
    * it is important that the new file is newly created, not just copied and pasted
    * the file path needs to be all lower case, it triggered after lower casing it in the file path trigger, not sure how the `strinh-test-img` worked with the file path with upper case
    * posted screenshots of new file on `F:\` drive thru windows preludeX01 server and separate TS platform screenshot of workflow completion logs, and `File Info` tab results

- BG267 - Dotmatics browser page inconsistency for ">" cases
    * test sql below for `PDF_CONFIG_EXPORT.sql`
