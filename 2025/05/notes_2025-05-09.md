## 📝 Day 144, Friday - `notes_2025-05-09.md`

### BG267
- pushed changes for `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` and `PDF_EXPORT_CONFIG` on PROD

### US261|US255
- pushed changes from `TMP_SUMM_JAK2` to `SUMM_JAK2` on PROD
- ran below sql to prove the results have been flipped, since the values are different, due to `minr` calculation:
```sql
select dmax_set2 from tmp_summ_jak2
where formatted_id = 'PRT1007057'
UNION ALL
select dmax_set2 from summ_jak2
where formatted_id = 'PRT1007057'
```
- **Re-iterate or re-surface this point that is IMPORTANT**:
>Tried to update DS on PROD and it wouldn't complete the compilation. Tried waiting 3+ hours, however the page never changes. On DEV, the same SQL seemed to work (after 1-2 hours). Only explanation I could think of was that multiple users are using PROD, whereas DEV there was only me. So will try after 17:00 EST to update the DS. running the same sql in table browser completes in about 30-45 seconds, not sure why when applying changes in DS manager hangs up.
>I tried a quick fix and appended the CTG-UT-7 subquery which references `jak2_prolif_summary` DS, however the DS compiler is crashing and/or never completing, i think we have encountered the limit of this DS since it is 6000 lines of SQL code; it won't handle any more blocks of code; not in regards to number of chars or number of lines, but the memory load or something, there are probably too many cyclic JOINS in this DS

The original *monolithic* sql does a lot of unncessary joins that bloated the number of rows of the datasource but since it does an aggregate `MAX()` or `MIN()` the final results are as expected. But the underlying base SQL was extremely inefficient and when a new subquery was introduced, it crashed the compiler; never completing.

#### Summary
- Each time a new batch registration or sync event occurs, the system seems to:
    * Clear (empties) the existing compound holder (Compound Holder Emptied).
    * Overwrite it with the original registered value (36 mg) without considering any prior usage or solubilization.
    * Reset the inventory value to what’s in the IDS file (presumably coming Tetrascience).
- This strongly indicates:
    * The synchronization logic in the Tetrascience → Mosaic pipeline treats every batch registration or update as a full reset rather than an append/update operation.
    * Existing sample holder content is wiped, even if the same compound is being referenced, leading to inventory inconsistency and loss of tracking history.

- Within the tetrascience platform go to: Pipelines -> Pipeline Manager
    * then in the filter box, enter: `ffaa1d4a-bc4d-408b-a53d-1119c0d16814`
    * the pipeline is: `Inject Dotmatics Into Mosaic`
    * this workflow id refers to the `1012233.json` file that was referenced by TS in the forum exchange
    * go to RHS panel and click `View logs`; this will show the exact log output that TS tech support pasted into the forum exchange

- After presenting json payload difference, next step is to discuss with TS & Preludetx about the issue (possibly in following week)
