## 📝 Day 145, Monday - `notes_2025-05-12.md`

- Dotmatics support ticket that PreludeTx opened on Friday (9 May 2025) about Vortex user login issue:
    * [https://community.dotmatics.com/500QC00000LgRiu](https://community.dotmatics.com/500QC00000LgRiu)
    * dtx support came back with a sql query that showed the failed login attemps probably due to bad password or cache issue, in which the solution would be to delete the `tempdir` in the `C:\Users\{USERNAME}\vortex\tempdir`
    * seems the user was able to login on, `2025-05-09 16:03:20.783`, however several attemps prior to this, there was `failed forced hashed oracle authentication for: sgeeganage:******** (no matching hits from authentication query)`
    * sql statement for inspecting logs:
```sql
select * from ds3_userdata.authentication_audit
where isid='sgeeganage' and method != 'UNKNOWN'
order by TIME_STAMP DESC
```

### Tetrascience investigation of Inject Mosaic into DTX
- troubleshoot live issue when Preludetx updated formatted_batch_id with `002` suffix
    * the formatted_batch_id wasn't showing up with the new value in Titan Mosaic
    * within DTX can trigger new modified date change `ELASPED_SECONDS` column in `REGISTER_MOSAICINV_NEW` by changing stoichiometry briefly within Register and then re-set it back later
    * also another way is download and edit the `.json` file and the click the `Update New Version` to trigger the pipeline again, RAW to IDS
    * another way (but not clean) is to download and edit, then upload new file (the file path is not persisted); but it still triggers because of `dotmatics-register-compound` source type
    * sql query to investigate the DTX change of stoichiometry trigger, the `ELASPED_SECONDS` will show a low value

```sql
select * from REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW_NEW
where formatted_id in ('PRT1012969', 'PRT1012883')
```

- need to point FLA to production for PHERAstar, Tecan and Envision
    * used prod `ts-sdk-cfg.json` token for FLA
    * updated pipelines to use instrument_model
