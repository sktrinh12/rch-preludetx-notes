## üìù Day 146, Tuesday - `notes_2025-05-13.md`

### US278 - Migrate UAT FLA to PRD:
- need to point FLA to production for PHERAstar, Tecan and Envision
    * used prod `ts-sdk-cfg.json` token for FLA
    * updated pipelines to use `instrument_model`
    * noticed the fla label configs were mis-typed, `Disco-lx` instead of `Disco-Ix`, and `PreludeX01` instead of `PreludeIx01`
    * preludetx to notify and link up the computers to use shared drive instead of egnyte (action to take immediately)
    * reverted back 3 pipelines to egnyte due to network connection issues in the PreludeTx lab computers. The machines couldn't ping the fileservers

### US277 - assist TS tech support in troubleshooting mosaic pipeline
- preludetx started email thread with TS about api payload differences issue for mosaic pipeline that might be due to the different DTX versions 6.2 vs 22.1. Suquin from DTX needs to confirm which API endpoint is being used by TS
    * need to know why there is a mix of camel case and snake case in the payload keys
    * since python code is not exposed by TS, almost impossible to troubleshoot
    * read DTX api docs to check for differences in payload
    * all api endpoints show camel case
    * only endpoints that have somewhat related payloads are
        * `/browser/api/register/structures?sort=FORMATTED_ID.desc`
        * `/browser/api/register/salts?sort=REG_ID.desc`
        * `/browser/api/register/sdf/1201/validate`
        * `/browser/api/register/sdf/upload?url=<folder_accessible_to_server>/<file-name>.sdf`
