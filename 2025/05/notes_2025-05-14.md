## üìù Day 147, Wednesday - `notes_2025-05-14.md`

### US277 - Mosaic TS pipeline
- preludetx gave mosaic UI access to webserver to view audit logs:
    * `V126993` labware entered in Lookup search box to view the pertinent logs for PRT1012883 batch re-assignment
    * reviewed TS curl commands for DTX api calls (provided by Stephen from TS thru email)
    * seems as thou it was a prototype or testing phase, not the real code which would be expected to be in `python`
    * doesn't seem to make sense since `REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW_NEW` was stood up for this same purpose

There are multiple API endpoints used to build what TetraScience considers a "raw" Dotmatics file. This email outlines the process to retrieve and structure this data, focusing on both newly registered and recently modified compounds.

---

### üîç Step 1: **List All Structures (Compounds)**

**API Endpoint:**

```http
GET https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/api/register/structures?offset=1&size=100
```

* **Purpose:** Fetches a paginated list of all structures (compounds).
* **Pagination:** Use `offset` and `size` to iterate through results.
* **Data Returned:** May include `"modification date"` if a compound was updated.

---

### üÜï Step 2: **Get Compounds Registered in the Last X Days**

**Create a Search Filter:**

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/api/register/search_filters \
  --header 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \
  --form 'terms=[{"field":"REG_DATE","operation":2,"value":"01-12-19"},{"field":"REG_DATE","operation":3,"value":"17-12-19"}]'
```

* **Explanation:**

  * `REG_DATE` = Registration date
  * `operation: 2` = Greater than or equal (‚â•)
  * `operation: 3` = Less than or equal (‚â§)
* **Result:** Filters compounds registered between **Dec 1, 2019** and **Dec 17, 2019**.
* **Returns:** A filter ID (e.g., `311`) used in subsequent queries.

---

### üîÅ Step 3: **Get Compounds Modified in the Last X Days**

**Create a Search Filter:**

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/api/register/search_filters \
  --header 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \
  --form 'terms=[{"field":"MODIFIED_DATE","operation":2,"value":"01-12-19"},{"field":"MODIFIED_DATE","operation":3,"value":"17-12-19"}]'
```

* **Explanation:**

  * `MODIFIED_DATE` = Last modified date
  * Retrieves compounds modified between **Dec 1, 2019** and **Dec 17, 2019**.
  * **Returns:** A filter ID (e.g., `311`).
  * The WebKit prefix is a convention from WebKit-based browsers but is not required
  * The boundary separates the terms field (and any other fields if present).


---

### üìÑ Step 4: **Retrieve Compounds Using Filter ID**

**API Endpoint:**

```http
GET https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/api/register/structures?offset=1&size=100&search_filter=311
```

* **Purpose:** Returns compounds matching the date filters.
* **Includes:** Compounds with `"modification date"`, which can be used to detect changes since last sync.

---

### üîÑ Step 5: **Query Related Data for Each Compound**

Once a compound is identified (or re-queried if modified), fetch its associated:

* **Batches**
* **Samples**
* **Components**

Suppose the **compound (structure)** has ID `1001799` and is linked to **batch** `228762`:

#### 1. üîπ **Batches**

```http
GET https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/api/register/batches?id=1001799&offset=1&size=10&_=1575602565128
```

#### 2. üî∏ **Samples**

```http
GET https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/api/register/samples?id=228762&offset=1&size=10&_=1575602565128
```

#### 3. üî∏ **Components**

```http
GET https://prelude-dev.dotmatics.net/browser/api/register/components?id=228762&offset=1&size=10&_=1575602565128
```

* These calls help form the full **RAW JSON object** representing the compound and its related data.

### üß† **Summary of Key Concepts**

| **Concept**           | **Meaning / Use**                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REG_DATE`            | Field to filter based on **registration date** of the compound                                                                               |
| `MODIFIED_DATE`       | Field to filter based on **last modification date** of the compound                                                                          |

| Search Filter ID      | Returned after `POST` to `/search_filters`; used to query filtered compound sets                                                             |
| `regId`, `batchId`    | Keys in the resulting JSON; represent compound and batch identifiers                                                                         |

| `_=1575602565128`     | A cache-busting query parameter, often added by browsers; not strictly necessary but included in some tools to avoid caching in GET requests |

### US281 - Missed Request - KAT6B Kinetic assay with Nucleus upload
- user requesting new table of data for HeLa-KAT6B-HiBit Kinetic
    * from Nucleus upload using the `KAT6A_mapping.csv` file - however this is mis-leading since the users are using the smarca2 nucleus upload protocol
    * however, the real mapping file used is `SMARCA2_KINETIC_mapping.csv` which points to the `SMARCA2_KINETIC` table (it is not a datasource managed by DTX)
    * `NULL` row for `ENTRY_` number 1. Due to empty row in `Copy of 2024.11.05 SM2 and KAT6A Kinetic dotmatics.xlsx` file
    * doesn't show the `HeLa-HiBiT-KAT6B` cell line in the Nucleus datasource table (`SMARCA2_KINETIC`); seems the user hasn't uploaded the data
    * wrote skeleton SQL based on original KAT6A, use of `LOWER()` and `INSTR()`
