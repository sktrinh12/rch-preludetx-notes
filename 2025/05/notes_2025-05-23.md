### US285
- Review any datasources that are running, but not completing
    * changed `PI3K_HTRF_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` on PROD; no more error
    * noticed error in logs: `23May 12:40:18.341 gdalwadi     ERROR               STDERR - java.sql.SQLException: ORA-12899: value too large for column "DS3_USERDATA"."EXP_DETAILS_V4"."EXPERIMENT_RESULTS" (actual: 4410, maximum: 4000)`
        * actual: 4410: The string is 4410 bytes long.
        * maximum: 4000: The column can hold a maximum of 4000 bytes.
        * This usually happens with VARCHAR2 columns in Oracle
        * In a BYTE-based column (default in many setups), the size limit is measured in bytes.
        * If the column uses CHAR semantics, then it can hold 4000 characters, which may translate to more or fewer bytes depending on character encoding.
        * maybe change column type? `CLOB` ‚Äî for large character data.
    * other error: `java.sql.SQLRecoverableException: Closed Connection`
        * means that the application is trying to execute SQL on a JDBC connection that has already been closed, timed out, or lost due to network/database issues.
        * it‚Äôs possible the query took too long and exceeded some timeout, causing the connection to close before the operation finished
        * but the sql works in table browser
        * affected DS: `Z1_SUMM_NEW, Z2_SUMM_NEW, TMP_SUMM_JAK2, TMP_UNIQ_PLATES, USER_ACCESS_LOGS, USER_NAMES_SUMM`
        * all of these DS's share the same `Closed Connection` error
