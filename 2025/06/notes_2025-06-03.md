- Assist TS tech support in diagnosing inject dotmatics into mosaic pipeline
    * noticed the Registry 2.0 project uses `REG_MOSAICINV_VW` for the quantity (`Amount` column), which probably is not updated on TS side
    * check the `PRT1013116` number if there were changes made
    * indeed `REG_MOSAICINV_VW` doesn't show the changes, neither does `REGISTRY_MOSAICINV_NEW_VW`
    * this is probably due to a dtx api call to using `/register` endpoint to update a base table like `reg_samples` or `reg_batches`
    * seems the mosaic api call from tetrascience nodejs code is updating many labware items (537):
    * the first few lines of logs below seem to indicate there are over 10,000 tasks that were queued and in order for it to complete, need to run the pipeline once again; doesn't seem to correlate with what the user had in mind; leads me to think the logic is wrong

```
Mosaic has more then 10000 in the queue to process.
Rerun this pipeline once current run is over!
Number of update events for labware items: 537

- the code calls for nucleus upload (`DTX_MOSAIC_MAP` -> `DTX_MOSAIC_INFO`) so it should be re-worked/re-factored anyways

```sql
-- tetrascience linked data connector
select * from REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW_New
where formatted_id = 'PRT1013116'
;

-- Registry 2.0 ds
select * from REG_MOSAICINV_VW

;

-- check barcode and reg base table
select * from reg_samples
where
barcode = 'VIRT00184'

-- check resful logs for tetrascience api ping
select * from ds3_userdata.restful_audit
