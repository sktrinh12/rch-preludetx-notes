## 📝 Day 162, Thursday - `notes_2025-06-05.md`

### US295
- jak2 alisa datasource error on PROD
    * work on sql to update `ic50_rr` column to handle non-numeric value gracefully
    * pushed code to git on PROD
    * since the error was happening on PROD, fixed directly on PROD since it was not happening on DEV, the different set of data did not exist on DEV to produce the same error

### US293
- investigate api authentication from 34.235.21.0 ip address on DEV
    * TS responded to email about polling interval
    * confirmed list of multi-tenant TDP NAT gateway IP addresses

### US273
- T47D assay data for KAT6A
    * made changes to `SUMM_KAT6A` on DEV
    * working on `SUMM_KAT6A_MSR` and `SUMM_KAT6A_OMSR`
    * not sure if adding PI3Kα to project name will do the job, but it includes the PRT#'s with T47D cell line: `PRT1006049` and `PRT1006052`
    * but still doesn't include in the `SUMM_KAT6A_MSR` DS probably because `c` count and/or `time_hr`
    * or it is due to the data not matching what is requested, since the very last sql query below that queries based on reference compound only shows cell line = `LCLC-97TM1`

```sql
