### US273
- T47D assay data for KAT6A
    * work on `SUMM_KAT6A_MSR` and `SUMM_KAT6A_OMSR` since these are also part of the table in the Assay Data project page for KAT6A
    * change `FORMAT` and `CONDITIONAL FORMATTING` for both MSR/OMSR Datasources to match


```sql
select
    *
from tm_protocol_props_pivot
where cell_line = 'T47D'
and ASSAY_TYPE = 'CellTiter-Glo'
and reference_compounds is not null
;

SELECT 
  distinct reference_compounds
FROM
(
      SELECT
       substr(a.reference_compounds, 1, 10) AS reference_compounds,
       b.created_date,
       assay_type,
       row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY a.project_code, assay_type, cell_line
                          ORDER BY b.created_date DESC) AS r
     FROM tm_protocol_props_pivot a
     JOIN kat6a_summary_vw c ON substr(a.reference_compounds, 1, 10)=c.formatted_id

     WHERE reference_compounds IS NOT NULL
       AND assay_type IS NOT NULL
     ORDER BY created_date DESC

-- above returns: PRT1007160, PRT1006850, PRT1006052, PRT1007037, PRT1006049

### US293
- investigate api authentication from 34.235.21.0 ip address on DEV
    * TS updated poll interval to 15 mins on DEV:
    * TS commented below; this to me sounds like they used legacy code to connect to DEV whilst the newer code was used on PROD which may explain the json payload difference

>The Dotmatics connector is an older integration that has not been touched in years, and is not used by other customers currently. I agree this should be in the UI, and will be a consideration when/if this connector gets updated to our new framework.

- logs on DEV now show wider spread interval API connections:
