## üìù Day 164, Monday - `notes_2025-06-09.md`

### US273
- T47D assay data for KAT6A
    * work on `SUMM_KAT6A_MSR` and `SUMM_KAT6A_OMSR` since these are also part of the table in the Assay Data project page for KAT6A

### US277
- 
    * copy intermediate `.json` file and convert to real `.json` from the TS platform to reply to DTX support on Nucleus upload

### Code Ocean
**Code Ocean** is a cloud-based computational research platform designed to make scientific code and data more **reproducible, shareable, and reusable**. It acts as a "digital lab notebook" for computational work, addressing common challenges in research and data science.  

### **What It Does**:  
1. **Compute Capsules**:  
   Packages code, data, environment (libraries, dependencies), and results into a single reproducible unit called a **"capsule"**. This ensures experiments run identically every time.  
2. **Cloud Execution**:  
   Runs code in pre-configured, cloud-based environments (CPU/GPU) without requiring local setup.  
3. **Version Control**:  
   Tracks changes to code, data, and environments, allowing users to revert to prior states.  
4. **Collaboration & Publishing**:  
   Enables sharing capsules privately or publicly (e.g., via journals or institutions).  

---

### **Why It‚Äôs Useful**:  
1. **Reproducibility Crisis**:  
   Solves the "it works on my machine" problem by encapsulating the *entire computational environment* (e.g., Docker containers). Critical for peer-reviewed research.  
2. **No Setup Hassles**:  
   Eliminates dependency conflicts, OS issues, or installation headaches. Researchers launch pre-configured environments instantly.  
3. **Preserves Research Integrity**:  
   Journals/institutions use it to verify results by re-running code alongside published papers.  
4. **Accelerates Collaboration**:  
   Teams share executable workflows (not just raw code), making onboarding and iteration faster.  
5. **Scalable Compute**:  
   Run heavy computations on-demand without local hardware limitations.  
6. **FAIR Principles**:  
   Makes research **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable.  

---

### **Key Use Cases**:  
- **Academic Research**: Journals require Code Ocean capsules for computational papers.  
- **Corporate R&D**: Teams standardize workflows, ensuring consistency in models/algorithms.  
- **Education**: Instructors distribute executable assignments; students focus on concepts, not setup.  
- **Data Science**: Deploy and track ML pipelines with pinned dependencies.  

---

### **Example Workflow**:  
1. Upload Python/R/Julia code + dataset.  
2. Code Ocean auto-builds the environment (e.g., Python 3.9 + NumPy 1.22).  
3. Run analyses via a web IDE or scheduler.  
4. Share a DOI-linked capsule for others to replicate results with one click.  

**Alternatives**:  
- *Jupyter Notebooks* (lacks environment control).  
- *GitHub* (requires manual setup).  
- *Binder* (limited compute/resources).  

Code Ocean bridges the gap between raw code and executable science, making computational research more trustworthy and efficient. Ideal for fields like bioinformatics, climate science, ML, and any data-driven discipline.
