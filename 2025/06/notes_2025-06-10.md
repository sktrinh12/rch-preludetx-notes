### US277
- Assist TS tech support in diagnosing inject dotmatics into mosaic pipeline
    * DTX support able to extract the Nucleus uploaded file, `mosaic_to_dotmatics_TDP_update_20250602_2007.csv`

>While the logs indicate an authentication error, I do see in the logs that the file was successfully parsed and data was written to the DS3_USERDATA.DTX_MOSAIC_INFO table. This might suggest that the authentication issue did not prevent the import from proceeding.

```bash
2025-06-02 16:07:46.687 NUC ERROR [Authenticator:authenticateViaBrowser] authentication via browser failed, [authenticated:false, errorMsg:Authentication failed : Missing Browser security token, Relaunch Nucleus from Browser, see logs for error messages],"./nFor Browser based authentication of Nucleus, modify TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/nucleus/WEB-INF/nucleus.properties for key :

```


>That said, I noticed that **not every row from the CSV appears in the** DTX_MOSAIC_INFO **table**. Upon closer inspection, the missing rows in the output table appear to have repeating values in the BARCODE, BATCH_ID and FORMATTED_ID columns. These three columns are defined as merge columns in the mapping file. Because of that configuration, Nucleus performs a **merge operation**, where rows with matching values in the merge columns are updated rather than appended. This means that for entries with duplicate merge keys, only the **last occurrence** in the import file will be retained in the destination table. For example, in the screenshot, only Location **karen/O03** is saved for the three repeating rows in DTX_MOSAIC_INFO. 


- not sure why the barcode shows `karen` in the `.csv` file, this may perhaps be the cause of the issue:

### US299
- Create diagram for genaro & raul describing MOSAIC tables 
    * **DTX_MOSAIC_INFO**: Stores raw mosaic data directly entered by the mapping file thru Nucleus
    * **REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW**: A legacy view that assembles batch/sample info with timestamps; is used in Registry 2.0 project view
    * **REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW_NEW**: Improved version of the above using optimized joins and subqueries, probably written by TS or Zifo during development of the `Inject Mosaic into Dotmatics` pipeline. Used in `REGISTERED_COMPOUNDS` project page
        * both `MOSAICINV` tables join on the following base registry tables: `C$PINPOINT.REG_SAMPLES sam , C$PINPOINT.REG_BATCHES bat , C$PINPOINT.REG_BATCH_MW mw , C$PINPOINT.REG_DATA`
        * not sure how data uploaded to `DTX_MOSAIC_INFO` is shared/transferred to any of the `REGISTER_MOSAICINV` tables

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Is sample duplication in legacy view intentional? | No, seems like a side effect of joins; likely unintended. `REG_MOSAICINV_VW` selects from `register_mosaicinv_vw JOIN reg_batches_vw b ON a.batch_id=b.batch_id` |
| Is `REGISTER_MOSAICINV_VW_NEW` a fix? | Perhaps, designed to fix duplication by refined logic, however seemed to have been developed only for the mosaic pipeline |
| Was the new view rolled out? | Unknown, probably in testing or partial rollout. Not sure why it was not updated on Registry 2.0 project view, and other unknown is that the mosaic pipeline does not directly update this view. |
| Are both views updated by Mosaic pipeline? | No, pipeline updates `DTX_MOSAIC_INFO` only. |

### US292
- investigate api error logs on PROD
    * based on DTX response no action can be taken and the error has to be ignored since the solution is to upgrade to 6.2 version
    * response from DTX:
>the `/api/configure/app.rwdResponsive` endpoint is called from the frontend to check if `rwdResponive` is enabled. But that connection is not callable by non-admins and results in 69 lines of logging each time a non-admin visits a Browser or Studies notebook page. This is a defect as this is generating unexpected errors in the logs and taking up browser log space. Please feel free to reference JIRA ID **DUX-1099**.

>`rwdResponsive` is browser property. This occurs when a non-admin user hits `query.jsp` or `experiment.jsp`. There is a script that runs and checks for the browser property `app.rwdResponsive` via the `/browser/api/configure` api collection (`rwdResponsive.js`). Since the configure API collection can only be accessed by admins, it throws the error.
