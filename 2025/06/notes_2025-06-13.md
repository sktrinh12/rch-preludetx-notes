- meeting with Xi Li from DTX and Genaro today @11:00. Briefed Xi on more details about the `Inject Mosaic into Dotmatics` pipeline. She confirmed that Nucleus cannot upload to other schemas besides `ds3_userdata` therefor the reasoning of `DTX_MOSAIC_INFO` however why not update `REGISTRY_MOSAICINV_VW_NEW` directly as in the opposite pipeline `Inject Dotmatics into Mosaic`?
    * only option is to do a `JOIN` on `DTX_MOSAIC_INFO` to display the new data. However, the first step is to as TS to update code to handle empty arrays, `[]` from mosaic api calls to proceed thru the long queue of labwares

### BG282
- observed replicate counting error for KAT6B HiBiT
  * work on sql ds: `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`
  * since DEV doesn't have the same data, will work directly on PROD (Genaro approved)
  * BG282 and US273/US303 share same underlying issue
  * updated `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` DS on DEV and PROD and BG282 was resolved on PROD whereas US273/US303 were resolved on DEV; this is do to the difference datasets living on both environments
  

### US304
- typo in bioreg ab target LILRB4
    * sql to find the ab target:

```sql
select * from c2c.string_value
where VALUE like 'LI%'
;

-- update stmt:
update c2c.string_value
set value = 'LILRB4'
where type_id = 6
and ID = 3858
and owningclass = 'Complex'
and owner_id = 487
```
