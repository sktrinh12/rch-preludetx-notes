## 📝 Day 170, Tuesday - `notes_2025-06-17.md`

### US273
- T47D assay data for KAT6A
    * added roll out and back out plan for autotask to be sent to preludetx for closing the autotask ticket
##### Roll Out Plan
The following datasources were modified: SUMM_KAT6A, SUMM_KAT6A_MSR, SUMM_KAT6A_OMSR, KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY. All SQL code is updated for each datasource git logged/version controlled. The new changes were tested immediately on DEV after having saved the sql changes within the datasource manager. Amy then tested and confirmed updates; migrating to production was the next step.

##### Back Out Plan
If changes need to be rolled back we will re-write the SQL to set it back to where it had originally been set to (by doing a git revert). There is essentially zero to extremely low risk of failure since the SQL is git logged and all changes are tracked. Simply copying and pasting an older version would be the back-out plan.

### BG282 
- observed replicate counting error for KAT6B HiBiT
##### Roll Out Plan
The following datasource was modified: KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY. All SQL code is updated for each datasource git logged/version controlled. The new changes were tested immediately on PROD since there were no existing data to be tested on DEV and approval communicated from Genaro. Spencer showed screenshot of before and after of the N-count to prove the fix was applied. Amy and Genaro then tested and confirmed updates.

##### MT message:
[Genaro Scavello (External): Preferred to change on DEV, but if there is no data available, use PRD for this instnace. https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:2e96da98-54ba-47c9-9fb1-c1d689194bef_d08cdf5c-26c3-4d20-95d4-e747edfebd24@unq.gbl.spaces/1749830709396?context=%7B%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D)
