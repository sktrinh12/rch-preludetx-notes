## 📝 Day 173, Friday - `notes_2025-06-20.md`

### US275
- UAT testing BioChem-PheraStar Experiments with TetraFLA
    * skimmed dtx studies api swagger and seems the `BMG Labtech Pherastar IDS to Dotmatics` pipeline reads the decorated (labeled) `.csv` file which is triggered first; then subsequently, conversion into IDS (`.json`) and finally from the labels; mosaic api calls are made and finally dtx studies apis call. 
    * last time `BMG Labtech Pherastar IDS to Dotmatics` pipeline worked was `2025-03-05 15:59:05 EST`
    * The empty array issue has been preventing successful completion of this pipeline for some time it seems

### BG309
- Troubleshoot why 272646 was processing in both Envision and PheraStar.
    * the error points to mosaic api empty array like the other pipeline, inject mosaic into dmx:
    * today TS replied that no changes can be made without a SOW or billable work statement has been established, so the code changes for the empty array cannot be completed
    * checking the 272646 exp id `.csv` file on TS PROD only shows one file, and it was triggered by PheraStar pipeline and not Envision; pasted screenshot of search results showing only one file

```
Mosaic returned an empty list from this endpoint 'https://prelude.mosaic-cloud.com/api/inventory/LabwareItems?barcodes=272646_01&expand=sampleHolders&include=disposed'
```

### US311
- editing binding columns in form throws error about no admin rights, unhandled exception
    * couldn't replicate the error on DEV even after creating new column in `SUMM_KAT6A` (`test`) and repeating the similar steps of appending to an existing table on `KAT6A` project page
    * DTX (Xi) wasn't able to replicate the error either on a cloned form; she only suggested turning on verbose logging

### US305
- add abs ic50 or dc50 value to summary table kat6a/b
    * If compound is inactive - flag IC50 and ABSIC50 as >highest conc 
    * If compound is very potent - flag IC50 and ABS IC50 as < lowest concentration  
    * Add prefix in summary page and assay data
    * separate ticket will be opened to capture work done to add the logic mentioned about prefixes (thread below).
    * for now the work for this project has been completed after meeting with Min and Genaro
    * when migrating to PROD, the same error occurred when editing column bindings. Sent follow-up email to DTX support; after waiting 3 hours still cannot edit the column bindings.
    * test PRT#'s for this user story:
        * PRT1007160
        * PRT1006850
        * PRT1011760
        * PRT1011761
        * PRT1011764
        * PRT1011806
        * PRT1011909
        * PRT1012111
        * PRT1012118
