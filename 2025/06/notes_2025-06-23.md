### US311
- editing binding columns in form throws error about no admin rights, unhandled exception
    * DTX (Xi) has not responded yet. sent screenshots and logs for same error on PROD
    * explained the main step is to change something on the existing DS
    * this error log may be some type of bug that checks whether current user has rights to make changes on form:
```
20Jun 14:35:24.980              ERROR         PopulateUser - SQL: SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, E_MAIL,RESTRICTIMG FROM DS3_APPDATA.IG_USERS_TAB WHERE ISID = ? returned no rows for isid: 'null'

### US305
- add abs ic50 or dc50 value to summary table kat6a/b
    * after weekend made changes to PROD without errors or issues
    * now the form has been updated like on DEV

### US310
- SUMM_KAT6A_KINETICS datasource error on PROD
    * errors continue to be relayed from `relay@dotmatics.com`
    * fixed issue on DEV; awaiting approval on PROD to migrate

### US313
- add prefix logic for KAT6 project for displaying ic50/abs ic50
    * work on sql `SUMM_KAT6A` datasource to add this logic
    * translated the business logic into pseudo-code logic:

```
- If classification column is 'inactive' -> set IC50 and ABSIC50 as concatentation of, '>' and highest conc column
- If classifcation is 'very potent' -> set IC50 and ABS IC50 as concatentation of, '<' and lowest concentration column
```
