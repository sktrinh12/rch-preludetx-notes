## 📝 Day 176, Wednesday - `notes_2025-06-25.md`

### US315
- error on DEV for `KAT6A_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` datasource
    * after removing of `PERCENT_INHIBITION` and keeping just `Y_AT_MAX_X`; the error seemed to have disappeared since the following day no error in logs or from `relay@dotmatics.com`
    * also checked system logs and no sign of same error
    * considered closed, however awaiting preludetx approval 

### US316
- change dar value for PRT5000406
    * investigate where this value is stored in backend (sql tables)
    * can change thru SQL: `update c2c.complex set COMPOSITION = '2*43+2*44+7*PRT1011332' where BIOREG_ID = 'PRT5000406' and ID = 446`
    * or change proper way: BIOREGISTER -> Complexes -> ADC List -> Enter bioreg ID (to filter list) -> ADC Batches -> Edit DAR value within Column
    * the other similar way using sql is below, actually the value to be changed is not the DAR value but the `STOICHIOMETRY`
    * this request was actually closed for some time now; just never transferred to DEVOPS board


```sql
-- find the owner id, this shows 446 as owner id
select * from c2c.complex where BIOREG_ID = 'PRT5000406' 
;

-- from the composition you can see the chemical warhead component and set owner_id
select * from chemical_component
where compound_id = 'PRT1011332'
and owner_id = 446
;

-- additional info on other components
select * from protein_sample_component 
where id IN (446, 68)
;
```

### US313
- add prefix logic for KAT6 project for displaying ic50/abs ic50
    * continue working on updating sql for `SUMM_KAT6A` and `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`
