### US314
- Error displaying KAT6A HiBiT DC50 for PRT1011950
    * the issue is the `COMPOUND_STATUS` is aggregated on, so it separates the IC50 calculated value
    * in relation to above the `CLASSIFICATION` is different, 'Very Potent' and 'Good Curve'
    * The difference in these values occurs because they are being aggregated separately based on the compound_status column:
        * For `compound_status = '<'` (non-null):
        * Only includes individual measurements like `0.06493500002238`
        * These are typically raw, unaggregated data points
        * For `compound_status` IS NULL:
            * Represents aggregated/processed data
            * The average of 5 IC50 values (`0.31823...`) was calculated from:
                * Measurements that were specifically marked with `NULL` `compound_status`

    * because the main outer query calls for `MIN(ic50_nm_hibit) AS ic50_nm_hibit,` it is grabbing from one of the two rows of the [sql output table](#output-of-above-sql)
        * the `MIN()` of $0.3182347$ *and* $0.0649350$
        * that is why the KAT6A-HiBiT Data table shows $0.0649350$ in the `DC50` column and not the `0.28` that was reported by user

```sql
