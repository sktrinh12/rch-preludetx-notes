### US300
- error on PROD server; instruments_info table insert
    * original ticket was only on DEV, however fixed on PROD

```sql
--original sql
select project_name
from c$pinpoint.reg_projects a
left join DS3_USERDATA.tm_prot_exp_fields_values b
on a.id = b.property_value
where experiment_id = -EXPERIMENT_ID-
and Property_name like '%Project Code%'
;

-- update sql
UPDATE DS3_USERDATA.TM_PROT_EXP_FIELDS_DICT
SET SQL = q'[select distinct project_name from c$pinpoint.reg_projects a left join DS3_USERDATA.tm_prot_exp_fields_values b on a.id = b.property_value where Property_name = 'Project Code']'

-- second update sql
UPDATE DS3_USERDATA.TM_PROT_EXP_FIELDS_DICT

### US308
- error in DS for STUDIES_SUMMARY_V4
    * updated datasource on PROD
    * now in healthy state


- both #US300 and #US308 were completed to close #US312 - Rainy day repairs of Summary and DEV Instrument Info form

### US319

- find `BIOLOGYELN` project

```sql
-- project id = 5000
select * from ds3_appdata.projects
where description like 'B%'
```

- ran sql to check if `dataIG_user_views` contained this datasource üö´
- ran sql to check if `dataIG_project_views` contained this datasource üö´
- searched and checked `XML` forms of `BIOLOGYELN` project (`Summaries_v1.0` & `Document Search`) for `DS_ID` related to the below datasources, i.e. 1366 and 1354, however not found - leading to belief that the DS's v4 and v6 aren't used in the forms
    * however `v4` is used as summary view in the `BIOLOGYELN` project
    * also when manually checking each table column of `BIOLOGYELN` project form page in `Layout` mode, able to find a few bindings to `v4` DS but not `v6`
- `v6` is a `dyanmic` datasources, thus the use of mask placeholders in the SQL of the datasource

```sql
-- check DS_ID of datasources
select * from data_sources
where --ds_id = 542
table_name like 'STUDIES_SUM%'
;

-- show project forms of biologyeln project
select * from project_forms
where project_id = 5000
;

-- show XML CLOB of form for particular sections
select * from ds3_appdata.user_forms
where project_id = 5000
;
```

#### original sql for `STUDIES_SUMMARY_V6` on DEV

#### formatted sql for `STUDIES_SUMMARY_V6` on DEV
- removed the mask placeholder section
    * converted DS `STUDIES_SUMMARY_V6` (DEV) into view and removed mask placeholder part in SQL
    * error in logs disappeared as well on DEV
    * change FULL to LEFT JOIN; to match logic of `v4` which is 90% the same
