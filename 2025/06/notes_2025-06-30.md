### US321
- Investigate method to monitor Dotmatics system performance
    * idea is to run selenium to run sql queries in table browser and extract output (html) and dump into a InfluxDB
    * afterwards use a docker container of Grafana to link to InfluxDB and show dashboards of the oracle db
    * some queries to use for the data
    * worked on docker-compose file with two containers: 1) grafana 2) influxdb

    segment_type
