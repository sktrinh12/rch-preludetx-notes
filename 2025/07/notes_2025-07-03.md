### US320
- Duplicate/Missing Data for MCF7 Assays in Dotmatics
    * The column being pivoted: ic90 (which comes from t8.result)
    * The pivot key: name (which comes from t9.name)
    * Each result name (e.g. % Max Response) becomes a column
    * The value for that new column is the MAX(ic90) where name = '% Max Response'
    * that is the `MAX` column, not `MAX_RESPONSE`; they are different, max is param2 from DTX fitting model, max_response is a percent value inputted by the user
    * data for 176060 shows NULL for max_response, thus it is not included in the datasource
    * need to confirm with scientist to ensure that logic is relevant
    * the underlying SQL logic is unexpected and seems very esoteric for this experiment; where t8.max_response is NOT NULL
    * so if the data point has null max_response it is not included in the DS

```sql
-- this snippet is where max_response is derived from
-- coming from the IC50_NEW_RESULTS_SUMMARY datasource
t PIVOT (
    MAX(ic90)
    FOR name
    IN (
        '% Max Response' AS max_response,
        'Absolute IC50' AS absolute_ic50,
        'Highest Concentration (¬µM)' AS highest_concentration,
        '% Response @HC' AS response_at_hc
    )
)
```

- checked the group settings analyses names:
    * for 176060 it is using `IC50 Cell Viability new` and for 263207 `IC50 Cell Viability - IC10`
    * there really is no difference in params for the two as shown in SQL
    * but the `JOIN` on t8.su_derived_results shows NULL, thus the ic90 is null and finally the max_response is null
    * there is one slight difference in the two analyses: the DEFAULT_SLOPE_MAX where in in IC50 Cell Viability shows 0 and other is NULL
    * the SQL above shows all of the model parameters for these two analyses used. 176060 does **NOT** have data because the su_derived_results is empty; however for a random other expt, 263207, it does have data

### US325
- investigate why data is not populating for 273235 & 273236 in KAT6A
    * wrote test sql to see what is missing
    * based off of `ic50_exp_info` it shows NULL for 'Project Name' thus it won't be captured by `KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY` in the `WHERE project_name_ro IN ( 'KAT6A', 'KAT6A - Deg' )`
    * within the ds sql code for `ic50_exp_info` this is the relevant line: `max(decode(property_name,'Project Name',property_value)) as Project_Name_RO,`
    * User mentioned that the study was not populating the project when entering the number; however all dropdown menus work as shown in screenshots attached to devops board
    * User needs to input this properly in order for it to show

   to_number(a.experiment_id) AS experiment_id,

```


### US323
- investigate memory error on DTX
    * created table for easier viewing and organisation
    * created jupyter notebook, `plot_mem_usage_dtx_error.ipynb` in `scripts/notebooks` directory
    * export line graph and uploaded to devops board
