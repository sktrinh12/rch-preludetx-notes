## 📝 Day 184, Tuesday - `notes_2025-07-08.md`

### US323
- investigate memory error on DTX
    * today no email from relay@dotmatics.com arrived in inbox
    * perhaps DTX did something on their end
    * responses from DTX have been very underwhelming and not helpful

### BG328
- MSR data appears for KAT6A compound that has not been screened yet 
    * confirmed issue on DEV/PROD
    * added more CASE STMT to be more specific in the `SUMM_KAT6A_OMSR` and `SUMM_KAT6A_MSR` datasources
    * able to resolve issue after clicking `Run Query` on KAT6A home page and receiving first result; does not show the MSR/OMSR values anymore for `LCLC_97TM1`

```sql
-- investigate for specific PRT that was the first to be displayed when clicking `Run Query`
select * from summ_kat6a_msr 
where formatted_id = 'PRT1013356'
;
```

### BG329
- T47D data not populating for KAT6A
    * ran below sql's to investigate issue why it wasn't showing
    * from screenshots that Amy provided, 271912 should be showing, but was not
    * query links provided: `https://prelude.dotmatics.net/browser/query/browse.jsp?currentFormID=573&currentPrimary=PRT1012694#`
    * the Book shows, `PARENT`, Project was filled as 263, Project Code filled as 263, no Passage
    * other exp id, 272268 does show in browser:
        * Book is `KAT6A`, Project is NULL, Project Code is 263, Passage is 29
    * Closing Bug as it was a user error.  The user did not add batch numbers to compounds

### US314
- Error displaying KAT6A HiBiT DC50 for PRT1011950

    * explanation of why the prefix is null or ''

select

    cs_ic50_hibit from summ_kat6a
where x01_formatted_id = 'PRT1011950'
```

- basically the `CS_IC50_HIBIT` column does a `MAX()` and since the subquery shows `CS_IC50_HIBIT` of 0 or 2; the 2 will be selected and thus the prefix is not shown. this is the current implementation of the logic
    * if you run just as is using '*' you can see the inner nested subquery `CS_IC50_HIBIT` value of 0 or 2
