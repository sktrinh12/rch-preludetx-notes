## 📝 Day 185, Wednesday - `notes_2025-07-09.md`

### US323
- investigate memory error on DTX
    * mysteriously, have not been receiving the errors from [relay@dotmatics.com](relay@dotmatics.com) anymore
    * Genaro mentioned during meeting that perhaps when he changed the DS refresh intervals from `01:00` to `01:00, 07:00, 11:00, 14:00, 16:00`; there are overlaps with `11:00, 14:00, 16:00` which might have overloaded the system
    * but then he changed to `01:00, 07:00, 11:00, 13:00, 17:00`
    * there are SQL Runner tasks for:
        * `SUMM_KAT6A, SUMM_JAK2` Tues,Weds,Thurs at `11:00,14:00,16:00`
        * `GENERIC_ASSAY_DATA_EXPORT` Fri at `12:00`

### US321
- Investigate method to monitor Dotmatics system performance
    * created DS: `MOCK_EXPERIMENT_DATA`

### BG328
- MSR data appears for KAT6A compound that has not been screened yet 
    * closed since preludetx approved of changes; migrated to PROD

### US330
- Modify geomean averaging of compounds based on discussion with Andrew Buesking for KAT6 cell lines
    * ran sql to get unique cell lines:

```sql
