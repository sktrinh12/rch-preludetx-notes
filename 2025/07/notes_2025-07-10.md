## 📝 Day 186, Thursday - `notes_2025-07-10.md`

### US331
- Protocol 4PL - Luminescence Cellular IC50 does not populate the Project Read-Only value
    * wrote sql updates on PROD
    * created SQL Runner update:

```sql
-- first update sql
UPDATE DS3_USERDATA.TM_PROT_EXP_FIELDS_DICT
SET SQL = q'[select distinct project_name from c$pinpoint.reg_projects a left join DS3_USERDATA.tm_prot_exp_fields_values b on a.id = b.property_value where experiment_id = -EXPERIMENT_ID- and Property_name = 'Project Code']'
WHERE property_name = 'Project Name'
AND protocol_id = 544
;

-- second update sql
UPDATE DS3_USERDATA.TM_PROT_EXP_FIELDS_DICT
SET PROPERTY_TYPE = 'READONLY'
WHERE property_name = 'Project Name'
AND protocol_id = 544
;

-- view results after updates
select 
* from 
DS3_USERDATA.TM_PROT_EXP_FIELDS_DICT
WHERE property_name = 'Project Name'
AND protocol_id = 544
;
```

### US330
- Modify geomean averaging of compounds based on discussion with Andrew Buesking for KAT6 cell lines 
    * testing of `SUMM_KAT6A` minimised code block for `t10` subquery

```sql
-- correct 0.31 value after removing the 3 fields: classification, highest_conc, lowest_conc
-- add a auxiliary subquery to include 3 fields without aggregating on them
-- sql (1)

### Geometric Mean in SQL: Breakdown

#### 1. `LN(ic50)`

* **What it does**: Takes the natural logarithm of each `ic50` value.
* **Why it's needed**: The geometric mean formula involves multiplying values — but multiplying many small numbers can cause numerical underflow. Taking logs avoids that problem.

#### 2. `SUM(LN(ic50))`

* **What it does**: Sums up all the natural log values of `ic50`.
* **Interpretation**: This is equivalent to computing the log of the product of all `ic50` values.

#### 3. `COUNT(ic50)`

* **What it does**: Counts how many non-null `ic50` values there are.
* **Why it's used**: Needed to calculate the average log value — i.e., divide the total log sum by the number of items.

#### 4. `SUM(LN(ic50)) / COUNT(ic50)`

* **What it does**: Computes the **average of the logs**.
* **Mathematically**:

  $$
  \frac{1}{n} \sum \ln(x_i) = \ln\left(\sqrt[n]{\prod x_i}\right)
  $$

#### 5. `EXP(...)`

* **What it does**: Applies the exponential function (inverse of log).
* **Result**: Converts the average log back to the normal scale, giving the geometric mean.
