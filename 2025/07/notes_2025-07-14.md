- Modify geomean averaging of compounds based on discussion with Andrew Buesking for KAT6 cell lines
    * test changes to `SUMM_KAT6A` for one individual cell line, assay type combination
    * **PRT1011950**
      * `index`: 1
      * `time_hr`: 24  
      * `cell_line`: Hela-HiBit-KAT6A

### US106
- Dotmatics MW_EXACT in MW_VW
    * simply checked `MW_EXACT` in Schedules -> Calculations -> `calc-99ZQS0DV` (REG_DATA_PROPS)
    * saved and forced re-calculation, and now in `REG_DATA_PROPS` table, it shows the new column, `MW_EXACT`

```sql
select * from reg_data_props
where cp_id = 'PRT1009876'
```

- **Monoisotopic mass** is the exact mass of an atom using only its **most common (most abundant) isotope**.

#### ‚öõÔ∏è How Is It Defined?

* Scientists define the mass of **Carbon-12** to be exactly **12.000000** atomic mass units (**u**).
* The masses of all other atoms are measured **relative to Carbon-12**.
* These masses are measured using **very accurate instruments** like **mass spectrometers**.

---

#### üîç Why Only One Isotope?

* Many elements have more than one stable isotope.
* The **monoisotopic mass** uses only the **lightest and most abundant isotope**.

  * Example:

    * Oxygen: Use **O-16**, not O-17 or O-18.
    * Chlorine: Use **Cl-35**, not Cl-37.

---

## üìò Example Table

| Element | Isotope Used | Monoisotopic Mass (u) |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| H       | ¬πH           | 1.007825              |
| C       | ¬π¬≤C          | 12.000000             |
| O       | ¬π‚Å∂O          | 15.994915             |
| N       | ¬π‚Å¥N          | 14.003074             |
| S       | ¬≥¬≤S          | 31.972071             |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Monoisotopic mass** is the mass of a molecule calculated using **only the most common isotope** of each element. It gives the most accurate molecular mass for use in **mass spectrometry** and **exact mass** calculations.
    * In practice, Mass spectrometry is used to measure the mass of individual isotopes very precisely.
    * The measured mass is scaled so that ¬π¬≤C = exactly 12.000000 u.
    * All other monoisotopic masses are then reported in units of u, relative to that standard.

### US115
- Investigate mechanism for tracking all queries including input and outputs.
    * extracted notes from 11 Nov 2024 and pasted ggplot plots into devops board
    * updated notes in thread
    * these queries were only done on previous DEV server that was running version 22. It didn't contain up-to-date data. 
    * no official UserStory was created at the time since it was only vocalised during a meeting
    * `TMP_PROJ_USAGE` was created on DEV and the csv file was exported and R ggplot heatmap was generated for the email
    * `TMP_PROJ_USAGE` was deleted due to #US242 - Spring cleaning of DS on DTX


### US332
- Investigate best methods for migrating Generic Assay results to TetraScience
    * original for strinh-img-test pipeline
    * Source Type = 'egnyte'
    * File Path, `has path` = `/Private/lab-connect/Imaging/Attune_images_UAT/**/*.*`
    * updated `main.py` to view content of file; re-run using a text file instead of `.bmp` file

```bash
# first run conda activate tdp
# then `cd` into the tetrascience script directory where the task-script lives

- Seems the correct path due to [documentation](https://developers.tetrascience.com/docs/tetra-data-core-schemas):

>You can use Tetra Data Core Schemas to do any of the following:
>*   **Create a Custom IDS:**¬†Define your own programmatic IDS by inheriting from one of the top-level IDS classes in the¬†`ts_ids_core.schema.ids_schema`¬†module

However, seems very esoteric and closed:

>TetraScience provides access to an authenticated private package feed (`ts-pypi-external`) to integrate into your own internal package source. For access, contact your CSM

---

Maybe the only custom way without TS involvement is to create a custom pipeline from scratch that will have a python agent running on server, which generates data on server and the FLA would capture that data and upload to TDP, however seems like significant effort needed to adhere to IDS schema.

---

- The issue there is would be almost duplicating data, because you need to upload the actual file, and the content of the file, but uploading the content requires a custom IDS which the documentation evades discussing, probably on purpose in order to lock in clients into SOW's or long contracts.
    * seems not very practical and overly complicated
    * allowing TS to handle it will adhere to their best practices, however no transparency and locked in; expensive to change or alter things in the future; no one can work on the code besides them
    * rather than using TDP, simply run a cronjob that will upload to postgresl db that is accessible

--

#### Summary
TetraScience is mainly built for handling instrument data like raw files from lab equipment, not for syncing Oracle or SQL database tables. It expects data in a certain format and likely need their help (and pay for it) to set up something custom like this; especially since there is no existing IDS artifact for the GENERIC_EXPORT_DATA DTX API json output. Since we're just trying to pull data from Dotmatics via API and store it in some open-source (accessible db) to use with BI tools like Tableau or Spotfire or Juypter Notebooks, it's more practical to build our own sync process. TetraScience would just add complexity for no real benefit here.
