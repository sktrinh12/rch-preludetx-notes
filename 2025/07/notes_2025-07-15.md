## 📝 Day 189, Tuesday - `notes_2025-07-15.md`

### US332
- Investigate best methods for migrating Generic Assay results to TetraScience
    * read documentation and wrote notes
    * Seems the correct path due to [documentation](https://developers.tetrascience.com/docs/tetra-data-core-schemas) is to create a custom IDS since there is no tetrascience developed schemas to be used for this "use-case":

>IDS is a schema that is applied to raw instrument data or report files ... A series of different Tetrascience-developed schemas that are designed for different life science systems

- Tried to access [https://ids.tetrascience.com/common/dotmatics-register-compound/v1.0.0/schema.json](https://ids.tetrascience.com/common/dotmatics-register-compound/v1.0.0/schema.json) within the `schema.json` for `dotmatics-register-compound` IDS, however got: `Unauthorized access error`

#### Summary
TetraScience is mainly built for handling instrument data like raw files from lab equipment, not for syncing Oracle or SQL database tables. It expects data in a certain format and likely need their help (and pay for it) to set up something custom like this; especially since there is no existing IDS artifact for the GENERIC_EXPORT_DATA DTX API json output. Since we're just trying to pull data from Dotmatics via API and store it in some open-source (accessible db) to use with BI tools like Tableau or Spotfire or Juypter Notebooks, probably more practical to build our own sync process.

If getting more documentation on programmatically creating custom IDS can be shared with examples, this may be a viable option.

- DTX api endpoint for getting FORMATTED_BATCH_ID from SUMMARY VIEW of GENERIC_EXPORT_DATA project
- the length of the SUMMARY VIEW is, `select count(*) from generic_assay_summary_vw` 9835

### US321
- Investigate method to monitor Dotmatics system performance
    * ran 5x `.py` script to upload time-series data to influxdb
    * this will continue for next week or so to gain a period of data

### US330
- Modify geomean averaging of compounds based on discussion with Andrew Buesking for KAT6 cell lines
    * updated PROD `SUMM_KAT6A` without `n` count changes
    * wrote test sql queries for table browser to confirm geomean calcs were accurate:

```sql
