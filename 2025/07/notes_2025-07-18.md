## 📝 Day 192, Friday - `notes_2025-07-18.md`

### US321
- Investigate method to monitor Dotmatics system performance
    * change mermaid code to have the Airflow DAG as the initiator
    * updated devops board to reference airflow
    * in theory US321 and US332 can both use Airflow

### US332
- Investigate best methods for migrating Generic Assay results to TetraScience
    * updated devops board to reference airflow
    * Sample diagram workflow using Airflow
    * Instead of the weather API this would be the Dotmatics API
    * Instead of Streamlit visualiser, Grafana can be used or Superset, Spotfire, Jupyter notebooks, etc
    * Since we already have a standing psql db, this can be used for the Airflow backend, as well as the `GENERIC_ASSAY_DATA_EXPORT` synchonisation


### US334
- update geomean for lclc ctg kat6a
    * Amy noticed two issues on KAT6A project home page, empty `n` count
    * made a small change in sql and now shows the count properly
    * The reason it was not showing is bc the compound status is non null, i.e. they are not real numbers:
    * the other issue highlighted in red (top left) is a separate issue, the DS is `KAT6A_SUMMARY_VW` and nothing related to `SUMM_KAT6A` which was the only DS sql modified, so perhaps a new ticket may be opened to investigate that as a separate issue
    * the two `>` is due to the `LISTAGG()` meaning both ic50 values were non-real numbers

```sql
WITH t AS
    (SELECT
       formatted_id,
       assay_type,
       cell_line,
       listagg(compound_status, ' . ') AS compound_status,
       count(formatted_id) AS c
     FROM ds3_userdata.kat6a_registry_summary
    -- WHERE compound_status IS NULL
     GROUP BY
       formatted_id,
       assay_type,
       cell_line)
  SELECT *
  FROM t
  WHERE formatted_id = 'PRT1007160'
    AND assay_type = 'HiBit'
    AND cell_line = 'HeLa-HiBiT-KAT6B'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    ' ',
    ' ',
    ' ',
    ' ',
    NULL
  FROM dual
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    ' ',
    ' ',
    ' ',
    ' ',
    NULL
  FROM dual
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    ' ',
    ' ',
    ' ',
    ' ',
    NULL
  FROM dual
;


-- check SUMM_KAT6A after changes
select ic50_nm_hibit_kat6b,
n_ic50_hibit_kat6b
from summ_kat6a
where x01_formatted_id = 'PRT1007160'
```

#### Output of above sql
```
FORMATTED_ID,ASSAY_TYPE,CELL_LINE,COMPOUND_STATUS,C
PRT1007160,HiBit,HeLa-HiBiT-KAT6B,> . >,2
```


### US337
- setup mysql db on IX01 server
    * checked mysql docker tag, `lts` and shows: `ENV MYSQL_VERSION=8.4.5-1.el9`
    * on IX01 server spun up mysql using:
    * after genaro provided avanti access to IX02 server, download mysql shell and able to successfully connect to the mysql server running on IX01 server:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mysql-server \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${ROOT_PASS} \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=preludetx \
  -e MYSQL_USER=preludetx \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=${PASS} \
  -v mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  mysql:8.4.5

# after installing mysql shell from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/, able to access form prelude-ix02 server
# run this in windows terminal
