## 📝 Day 195, Wednesday - `notes_2025-07-23.md`

### US341
- develop script to ingest tecan file and upload using mosaic api
    * couldn't test `dev` mosaic endpoint due to different password
    * `401 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials`
    * test load will use 996996 or 997997 on PROD envir
    * since test/dev mosaic instance is not useful, older version and 1 year old data; preludetx said to just use prod envir for testing


### US344
- investigate edge cases where a Assay Data table and Summary do not match
    * PRT1013381 on SUMM_JAK2 DS doesn't show the prefix but shows the actual reported_value; needs to show the larger real value from another plate
    * investigate `IC50_NM_JH2_TYK2_PRT` in `SUMM_JAK2`
