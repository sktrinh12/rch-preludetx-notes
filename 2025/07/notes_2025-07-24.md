## 📝 Day 196, Thursday - `notes_2025-07-24.md`


### US344
- investigate edge cases where a Assay Data table and Summary do not match
    * `PRT1013353` does not exist on DEV; currently no way to test, probably need to request user to upload data to DEV
    * in regards to `<16.5` ic50 value, after looking into it on PROD, it should be the geomean of real numbers and thus a value of `32.18` need to confirm with user
    * created `TMP_T1_T2_SUMM_JAK2` datasource on PROD to test a sql query with the changes made
    * `KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY ...)`
        * This grabs the first value (based on the ORDER BY logic).
        * It's like saying: "From this group of values, give me the one that ranks first, based on my rules."
    * `MIN(...) KEEP (...)`
        * The `MIN` just means we're applying the ranking and picking the minimum `cs_ic50_nm_jh2_v617f_prt` value that comes first in the ranking.
        * (In many cases, `MIN` is required because `KEEP` needs an aggregate function.)
    * `CASE` WHEN `compound_status IS NULL THEN` ...
        * This affects the sort order. It gives priority to rows where compound_status is `NULL`.
        * Others (non-`NULL` status) are demoted (with `NULLS LAST`).
        * json payload for labwareItem

### US341
- develop script to ingest tecan file and upload using mosaic api
    * read up on mosaic api docs
    * need to understand the overall workflow from preludetx
    * inspect json payload of `labwareItem` endpoint
