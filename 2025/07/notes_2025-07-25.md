### US341
- develop script to ingest tecan file and upload using mosaic api
    * Obtained the OpenAPI Spec
    * Downloaded `swagger.json` file from Mosaic API documentation (via the "Download" button).
    * Installed OpenAPI Generator
    * Installed the CLI version of OpenAPI Generator
    * despite the initial `504 Gateway Timeout` error when checking Maven (used for version checks), the OpenAPI Generator recovered and successfully generated the TypeScript client code
    * Maven 504 error → This is unrelated to the actual generation. It’s just the CLI trying to check for latest versions online
    * Continued anyway → It defaulted to the local version (7.14.0) and successfully generated the TypeScript client using `typescript-fetch`
    * Warnings about "Error" model name → These are fine. The generator just renamed a model called `Error` (which conflicts with JS's native Error) to `ModelError`
    * need api password for DEV/UAT to test on Postman
    * According to the specification, task script converts a Dotmatics compound batch to a Mosaic substance. And then, each sample batch to a Labware Item.
    * Task script uses Mosaic Inventory REST API endpoints.
    * Below there is list of endpoints with description of current usecase.
        * [GET] `api/inventory/LabwareItems`- get Labware Item by barcode
        * [GET] `api/inventory/SampleHolders` - get Sample Holder by labwareItemId
        * [POST] `api/inventory/Substances/Lookup` - get Substance by name parts
        * [POST] `api/inventory/SampleHolders/{sampleHolderKey}/SetNeatSample` - update Sample Holder with substance amount
        * [POST] `api/inventory/SampleHolders/{sampleHolderKey}/DeleteSample` - delete substance from Sample Holder
        * [POST] `api/inventory/Substances/SynchroniseRegistrationSubstances` - create Substance i.e. synchronise Dotmatics->Mosaic
    * `{sampleHolderKey}` is defined as `labwareItemId@(xPosition,yPosition)` e.g. 31841@(1,1)
    * When synchronising substance definition task script uses provided Substance Type e.g. "Small Molecule"

```bash
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
```

- Ran the generator to produce typed API code:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i ./swagger.json \
  -g typescript-fetch \
  -o ./mosaic-api
```

- This generated:
    * `apis/`: contains TypeScript classes for interacting with each endpoint (e.g., `LabwareItemsApi.ts`)
    * `models/`: defines data models and request/response types
    * `runtime.ts`: core HTTP and serialization utilities

- Inspected the Generated Client
    * Verified the presence of methods like `labwareItemCreateLabwareItems()` and `labwareItemGetLabwareItems()` for interacting with labware
    * Compared to Docs
    * Recognized that the API documentation uses basic fetch for quick examples

- 💡 Notes
    * The generated client provides full type safety and better developer experience, especially for large projects

- tetrascience investigation of tecan file RAW to IDS to understand how to incorporate into this pipeline. idea is to use the ids from ts data and call the mosaic api to upload data; rather than parsing the file manually

```sql
SELECT "uuid", "parent_uuid", "pk", "name", "experiment_id", "id", "type", "rows", "columns", "additional_volume_value", "additional_volume_unit", "dmso_limit_value", "dmso_limit_unit", "donnot_shake", "donnot_dispense" FROM "client_preludetx_tecan_parser_v1_plates" where experiment_id = '274586' ;

-- returns parent_uuid = '4072efb1-6884-4d03-822b-bf6d93cbedd6'
-- returns uuid = 1b652805-bada-43ea-87e0-406c99308891

-- returns uuid = 'b3150250-5ceb-4551-a745-634e7d53b38b'

-- use the uuid from above in data_wells table to get all data
SELECT "uuid", "parent_uuid", "reference", "fluid_fk", "dispensed_location_row_number", "dispensed_location_column_number", "concentration_value", "concentration_unit", "total_volume_dispensed_value", "total_volume_dispensed_unit", "total_volume_well_value", "total_volume_well_unit", "dmso_value", "dmso_unit", "result_value" FROM "client_preludetx_tecan_parser_v1_tecan_file_data_wells"

- wrote python script `query-athena.py` to test querying tecan IDS data to get well data
    * created sql access keys to run the python script
    * run terminal cmd to export keys: `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(sed -n '2p' ~/Documents/creds/tetrascience-sql) AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(sed -n '3p' ~/Documents/creds/tetrascience-sql)`
    * runs very slow



### US340
- Visualize git commit stats to display work done up to date
    * uploaded `top_20_workid_commits.png`
        * sort highest number of git commits per DevOps work item
        * each commit could contain X number of changes
    * uploaded `num_commits_repo.png`
        * number of commits for the two existing repos
        * sql repo and general scripts repo
    * uploaded `top_20_workid_edits.png`
        * number of line changes or deletions per work item
        * US261 was the modularisation of datasource sql (6000 lines)
           * had to write python code to semi-manually export the data for QC'ing and confirmation of data after changes
        * US292 created two nbk files to analyse isid users and api calls; moved all other nbks to a notebook folder
        * US153 formatted and modified the following datasources: `SUMM_KAT6A, KAT6A_REGISTRY_SUMMARY, KAT6A_TRFRET_REGISTRY_SUMMARY KAT6A_ICW_REGISTRY_SUMMARY`
        * BG131 required re-formatting of sql thus tracked those changes (~5000+ lines)
        * US224 required numerous iterations of the `.ipynb` file that analysed the CRO mask issue
