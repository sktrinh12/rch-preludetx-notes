### US347
- assist Joy & Genaro in tetrascience envision pipeline file issue
    * [Trinh, Spencer: naming of csv files can't be random, the decoration pipeline will fail or create incorrect labels 2025-07-23 1300" | Chat | Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:2e96da98-54ba-47c9-9fb1-c1d689194bef_d08cdf5c-26c3-4d20-95d4-e747edfebd24@unq.gbl.spaces/1753797890957?context=%7B%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D)
    * file_name: `274584_01 20250723 cd3+ il2 stim-pstat5 alpha 2025-07-23 1300.csv`
    * `labels.name:"plate_number" labels.value:"01 20250723 cd3+ il2 stim-pstat5 alpha"`
    * `2025.07.28 kat6a with crbn.csv`
    * Issue with pipeline seemed to have gone to completion according to logs on TS, however on DTX side, the screening data was empty
    * Users were trying to upload new files which bloats the data lake and creates major confusion
    * Genaro deleted all associated files and re-uploaded; seems there was a confusion of what pipeline to run, tecan vs envision; also the naming of files was inconsistent and random
    * two guesses on code logic for tecan files are: 1) it grabs exp id from the filename, 2) grabs exp id from this section of the raw file: 

```text
Plates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Plate,Plate name,Plate ID,Type,Rows,Columns,Additional volume (uL),DMSO limit (%),Don't shake,Don't dispense

```

1) is definitely used in envision pipeline for the decoration step
- from tecan `readme.md`
>use `"experiment_id"` as file name to indicate which experiment this results come from.

- develop script to ingest tecan file and upload using mosaic api
    * continue working on `query-athena.py` script to query athena db for tecan experiment data and generate a payload for mosaic api

- SQL Query Fix Summary  

## **Problem Identified**  
1. **Duplicate Rows**: Initial query showed duplicate wells because plates with the same `parent_uuid` were being joined.  
2. **Missing Data**: Some wells (e.g., B12/B13) had `fluid_fk = NULL`, causing fluid details to be missing in results.  
3. **Type Mismatch**: `fluid_fk` (INT) in wells didn’t match `pk` (DOUBLE) in fluids, breaking the join.  

## **Solutions Implemented**  

### **1. Fixed Duplicate Rows**  
- Joined plates using `plate_fk = pk` instead of `parent_uuid` to ensure 1:1 mapping.  
- Ensured `plate_number` matches the barcode suffix (e.g., `plate_fk = 1` → `274507_01`).  

### **2. Handled Missing `fluid_fk` Gracefully**  
- Used `COALESCE()` to provide default values for wells with `fluid_fk = NULL`:  
  ```sql
  COALESCE(fluids.name, 'DMSO normalization') AS name,
  COALESCE(fluids.volume_dispensed_value, 10.4) AS volume_dispensed_value
  ```  
- Applied known values for `DMSO normalization` for 12/13 column wells (i.e. B12/B13).  

### **3. Fixed Type Mismatch in Joins**  
- Cast `fluid_fk` and `pk` to the same type (`DOUBLE`) to ensure proper matching:  
  ```sql
  ON CAST(wells.fluid_fk AS DOUBLE) = CAST(fluids.pk AS DOUBLE)
  ```  

```sql
SELECT "uuid", "parent_uuid", "plate_fk" FROM "client_preludetx_tecan_parser_v1_tecan_file_data" where parent_uuid = 'ce0fbbcf-85d8-4ed6-8253-e2df59d76ce1';
