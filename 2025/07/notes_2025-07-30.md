## üìù Day 200, Wednesday - `notes_2025-07-30.md`

### US344
- investigate edge cases where a Assay Data table and Summary do not match
    * made changes on DEV, newest SUMM_JAK2 sql updated; before only the modular version of SUMM_JAK2 was on `TMP_SUMM_JAK2` but since cannot test the form; had to make changes to `SUMM_JAK2`
    * tested two PRT#'s: `PRT1012821` and `PRT1012823`
    * the table browser shows the non-real values, the form also shows the non-real values


### US341
- develop script to ingest tecan file and upload using mosaic api
    * continue developing the python script, `query-athena.py`
    * need to assign the following meta-information on mosaic end for the api call:
        * location, i.e. \\Prelude\\Bld_01\\Lab_01\\Fridge 1
        * labware type, i.e. PerkinElmer_ProxyLV_384PS_6008280
    * during investigation noticed TS did not do a great job with ensuring the tecan file parser captures all relevant data, as can be seen in the screenshot, the fluid_fk value is NULL, which is used as a foreign key to relate to other tables in the SQL query. These are the 12/13 rows (in regards to this experimental plate type) which just contain DMSO but have real volume data that needs to be captured like in the excel file
    * json IDS for 274507 shows NULL value in `fluid_fk`
    * tecan worklist file for 274507 shows `Dispensed volume` and `Total well volume` values
    * on DEV created two test labware items successfully and able to view in GUI; turns out no need to call the create labwareitem prior to get the item id, just pass the entire payload with `sampleHolderIdentifier` appended

- json body
```json
[
  {
    "labwareTypeId": 10192,
    "barcode": "TEST_X00001",
    "comment": "Test create labwareitem from api call"
  },
   {
    "labwareTypeId": 10192,
    "barcode": "TEST_X00002",
    "comment": "Test create labwareitem from api call"
  }
]
```

- response 
```json
{"labwareItemIds":[86981,86982]}
```

]
```
- run the python script like so:

```bash
python query-athena.py --exp_id 274507 --mosaic_server prelude
```

- the generated `.json` files were then converted to alphanumeric well ids for easier interpretation (for only reading, not to be uploaded to http post/get in postman)
    * this was done to confirm well ids quickly since in Mosaic api the row and columns are defined differently

```bash
jq 'map(.sampleHolderIdentifier.position |= (. + {wellId: (["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P"][(.x-1)] + (if .y < 10 then "0\(.y)" else "\(.y)" end)) }))' 274507_01_solvents.json`
```

- fill in DEV substance ids into the `substance.json` payload since the query is running on TS PROD
    * then it is copied and pasted into postman to execute the api

```bash
jq '(.[].sampleHolders[].solutionSample.constituents[]? | select(.substanceId != null) | .substanceId) |= [232051,231800,32947][(now|floor % 3)]' 274507_01_substances.json | xclip -selection clipboard
```
