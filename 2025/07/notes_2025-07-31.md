## üìù Day 201, Thursday - `notes_2025-07-31.md`

### US341
- develop script to ingest tecan file and upload using mosaic api
    * continue work on `query-athena.py` - major changes
    * updated main athena sql to query 384 plate data from tecan IDS
    * confirmed that individual tables lack data from the original raw `.csv` file, mainly the 12/13 columns of pure DMSO solvent that contain valid volume values
    * mosaic api reverses x/y coordinates for solvent dispense (AddSolvents); possibly a bug
    * git repo'd the `query-athena.py` and `ssp-tecan-to-mosaic` project folder for the tetrasciecne pipeline
