## üìù Day 202, Friday - `notes_2025-08-01.md`

### US341
- develop script to ingest tecan file and upload using mosaic api
    * continue work on `query-athena.py`
    * work on new TS pipeline `Tecan RAW to IDS for Mosaic Samplebank` on UAT
        * the main pipeline is `Post Tecan IDS to Mosaic Samplebank`
    * deploying new ssp on tetrascience; ran into issue of initialising due to slow latency
    * necessary to run `poetry init` for new deployment
    * issue was in the `config.json` file which used a different slug name, and thus the error manifested
    * new ssp repo was git committed to `scripts`

```bash
poetry init

This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

- error shown when trying to publish `protocol`
    * in the `config.json` file it was referencing `tecan-ids-to-mosaic`
    * but the slug used in command was `tecan-to-mosaic`
    * deleted the task-script using: `ts-cli delete --type task-script --namespace private-preludetx-uat --slug tecan-to-mosaic --version v0.0.1 -c auth.json`, and re-deployed
    * that actually didn't fix the issue, and instead the `protocol.yml` file was updated like below
    * also the commands to publish were: `ts-cli publish --type  task-script --namespace private-preludetx-uat --slug tecan-to-mosaic --version v0.0.1 task-script -f -c auth.json` and `ts-cli publish --type protocol --namespace private-preludetx-uat --slug tecan-to-mosaic --version v0.0.1 protocol -f -c auth.json`
    * the `config.json` was updated to:

- `config.json`

- the test requirement:
    * find an experiment id that has substances that exist in the mosaic test environment
    * below sql query is based on 207587 exp id that has all existing PRT#'s on mosaic dev server (good test candidate)
    * used `DISTINCT` to get all unique PRT#'s
    * 207587 exp id, exposed a new issue with the tecan ids data on TDP, duplicate plates are indistinguishable, for example, two `.csv` files were uploaded to TDP: 1) `207587.csv` 2) `wait 207587.csv`
    * the user needs to specify what happens in this case; aws athena doesn't keep track of the date so cannot grab most recent one, only can grab from the file properties, but how to tie that to the sql parent_uuid?
