### Nucleus API review
- read docs and try to upload `.csv` file using postman
    * downloaded `Bioregister Nucleus Upload File.xlsx` from PROD Nuclelus page and reviewed template for uploading thru api
    * need the `sec_token` from DEV in order to test the api


### US352
- New ADC Project planning for CALR
    * client created new registry project code 276 on PROD in preparation for users to upload data according to this project
    * client also created project code 275 on DEV for CALR [US362]
    * once data is avaiable and affiliated with 276 project, DS sql changes can be made for the CALR browser project page
    * browser project id is `103000` on DEV

### US362

### US361
- Fix Dual Payload PRTs
    * Dual payload PRTs that are currently in PRD
    * `PRT5000486-001`
    * `PRT5000495-002`
    * plan is to delete the batch row in ADC Batch List; this in theory will delete from backend
    * user will then create new entity, not as PRT5000495-002 which has `Vandortuzumab_x0288` as one of the payloads

```sql
select * from complex_ 
where bioreg_id = 'PRT5000495'


select * from complex_ 
where bioreg_id = 'PRT5000486'
```
