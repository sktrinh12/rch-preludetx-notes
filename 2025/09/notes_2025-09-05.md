## üìù Day 226, Friday - `notes_2025-09-05.md`

### US364
- Ensure PRT5000495-002 is deleted from the backend of BioRegister
    * if just want to delete batch number, can be done using one sql delete statement otherwise if the entire 495 ADC needs to be removed, will have to run multiple sql delete statements
    * run SQL Runner with delete statement is possible without going thru DTX support; however probably no possibility of doing roll-back; ask client how they want to proceed
        * write DTX support ticket to delete batch 002, case #: 00080968
        * would have to open DTX support ticket and provide the sql to execute

```sql
select * from c2c.protein_sample
where NR_ID = 2
and complex_id = 545
```


### US363
- Modify BioRegister to accommodate dual-payload linkers
    * uploaded two screenshots of (1) multiselect input box for `payload` in ADC List and (2) second `DAR_LCMS` input box in ADC Batch List on DEVOPS boards
    * investigate backend for payload linker and payload relationships if no new logic can be implemented, draft email to DTX support to ask how to implement
        * because n number of PL and P will be inputted by the user

### US348
- Create a tool to transform user Mass-Spec data to a standardized analysis format
    * update local copy of jupyter code on windows server from the git repo; since the location of the code is 
    * uploaded `acetylation_analysis_client.ipynb` and `mass_spec_module.py` to use a file uploader widget instead of reading straight from `input_files`
    * also removed `exec()` of stringified code for cleaner imports
